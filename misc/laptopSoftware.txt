Convert my work laptop to work only stuff:

uninstalled (likely never install again).
============
google gears
divX plus

to install on new:
==================
brother: bradmin professional 3
tweak ui?
symmantec?
mathematica (cannot buy the student edition ... not full time).  Wait to see if there's a sale price again.

To possibly uninstall and reinstall on new:
==========================================
calculator powertoy
cleartype tuning applet
image resizer powertoy

To setup on both
================
windows live mesh 

To setup on xps:
================
various things copying over onto portable HD.  copy onto xps.  rename the t61 dirs to mark them for deletion later.
windows live writer ... how to clone settings from old laptop.  The  'my weblog posts' was copied over already, but it wants to reconfigure stuff.  could try that and see if it then finds my drafts.

t61:
====
delete all the personal stuff I've moved once done (do one TSM backup at work
first).

defrag D: once it is cleaned up.

Copy data and setup on new
==========================
pisacca 3
itunes -- my copy of the itunes content didn't work.  could try uninstalling itunes then delete and lay down the files in the original path, but that requires a d:\ which I don't have.  google for instructions on properly moving an itunes library.
