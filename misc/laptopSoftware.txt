Convert my work laptop to work only stuff:

uninstalled (likely never install again).
============
google gears
divX plus

to install on new:
==================
brother: bradmin professional 3
lotus symphony
lotus notes
tweak ui?
symmantec?
mathematica (cannot buy the student edition ... not full time).

To possibly uninstall and reinstall on new:
==========================================
calculator powertoy
cleartype tuning applet
image resizer powertoy

To setup on both
================
windows live mesh 

To setup on xps:
================
vimrc
various things copying over onto portable HD.  copy onto xps.  rename the t61 dirs to mark them for deletion later.

t61:
====
re-enable hibernation, when the C drive defrag is done.

delete all the personal stuff I've moved once done (do one TSM backup at work
first).

defrag D: once it is cleaned up.

notes archive access attempt.  close up notes after that, and copy the data
dir.  How much of that should be copied over replacing the data dir on xps?
