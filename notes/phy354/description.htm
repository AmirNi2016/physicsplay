<li>
With regards to the “cat problem” of HW6, if you are theoretically inclined, check out this <a href="http://www.frankwilczek.com/Wilczek_Easy_Pieces/128_Gauge_Kinematics_of_Deformable_Bodies.pdf" >essay</a> by Frank Wilczek on the “Gauge Kinematics of Deformable Bodies.” Gross, Politzer, and Wilczek won the Nobel prize in 2004 for the discovery of “asymptotic freedom” of the gauge theory of strong interactions (i.e., the ones that keep the quarks together in the proton).
