- solve and write up the other problem sets and the midterm and final.
- switch to dmath env for a lot of the equations (perhaps just do it uniformly).  I've got a lot that are overflowing and could stand to be broken up.
- have some on paper and partially written up lecture notes to finish up and add here.
- moved ../gabook/lagrangian/ chapter to ./galagrangian/.  Have some undefined references in both as a result.
- labels for answers (or questions) aren't right.  off by one.
