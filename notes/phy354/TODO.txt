- solve and write up the other problem sets and the midterm and final.  problem set 2 i/p.  want to look at the E - q \phi and do a comparison between the relativistic and non-rel results to see how they compare for small v.
- switch to dmath env for a lot of the equations (perhaps just do it uniformly).  I've got a lot that are overflowing and could stand to be broken up.
- have some on paper and partially written up lecture notes to finish up and add here.
- moved ../gabook/lagrangian/ chapter to ./galagrangian/.  Have some undefined references in both as a result.
- self references should be chapter references not citations:
   Warning--empty publisher in phy354:hamiltonian
   Warning--empty year in phy354:hamiltonian

- rework goldstein and tong problems in makequestion/answer format.

FIXED:
- labels for answers (or questions) aren't right.  off by one.
