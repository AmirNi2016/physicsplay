This document contains a few things

\begin{itemize}
\item My personal lecture notes for the Spring 2012, University of Toronto Advanced Classical Mechanics course (PHY354H1S).  This class was taught by Prof.\ Erich Poppitz.  I audited the wednesday lectures since the timing was convienent, and I took occasional notes, and did some of the problems.)

Typos and errors are probably mine (Peeter), and no claim nor attempt of spelling or grammar correctness will be made.  

The text for the course is \citep{landau1960classical}, but I don't actually own that one (I've got \cite{goldstein1951cm}).

These notes, when I took them, likely track along with the Professor's hand written notes very closely, since his lectures follow his notes very closely.

%\item Some notes from reading of the text.  One of the earlier of these was due to unfortunate use of an ancient edition of the text borrowed from the library, since mine had been lost in shipping.  That version didn't use the upper and lower index quantities that I'd expected, so I tried to puzzle out some of what myself from what I knew.
\item Some assigned problems, ungrades (not submitted since I didn't actually take the course).

%  This includes observations, notes on what seem like errors, and some solved problems.  
%
%\item Some worked problems associated with exam preparation.
\end{itemize}
