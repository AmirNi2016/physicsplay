This document contains a few things

\begin{itemize}
\item A collection of miscellanious notes and problems for my personal (independent) classical mechanics studies.

\item My personal lecture notes for the Spring 2012, University of Toronto Advanced Classical Mechanics course (PHY354H1S).  This class was taught by Prof.\ Erich Poppitz.  I audited the wednesday lectures since the timing was convienent, and I took occasional notes, and did some of the problems.)

Typos and errors are probably mine (Peeter), and no claim nor attempt of spelling or grammar correctness will be made.  

The text for the course is \citep{landau1960classical}, but I don't actually own that one (I've got \cite{goldstein1951cm}).

These notes, when I took them, likely track along with the Professor's hand written notes very closely, since his lectures follow his notes very closely.

\item Some assigned problems from the phy354 course, ungraded (not submitted since I didn't actually take the course).

%  This includes observations, notes on what seem like errors, and some solved problems.  
%
%\item Some worked problems associated with exam preparation.
\end{itemize}
