\section{Motivation}

In (\cite{transverseField}), a Geometric Algebra solution for the transverse components of the electromagnetic field was found.  Here we construct a superposition of these transverse fields, keeping the propagation direction fixed, and allowing for continuous variation of the wave number and angular velocity.  Evaluation of this superposition integral, first utilizing a contour integral, then utilizing an inverse Fourier transform allows for the determination of the functional form of a general wave packet moving along a fixed direction in space.  This wave packet will be seen to have two time dependencies, an advanced time term, and a retarded time term.

\section{Guts}

When the field is required to have explicit sinusoidal time and propagation direction, the field components in the transverse (to the propagation) direction were found to be

\begin{align}\label{eqn:waveguideRetardedAdvanced:foo7}
F_t &= \inv{i \left( \pm k \zcap - \sqrt{\mu\epsilon}\frac{\omega}{c}\right) } \spacegrad_t F_z 
F_t &= \frac{i}{k^2 - \mu\epsilon\frac{\omega^2}{c^2}} \left( \pm k \zcap + \sqrt{\mu\epsilon}\frac{\omega}{c}\right) \spacegrad_t F_z
\end{align}

Here $F_z = F_z(x,y) = \BE_z(x,y) + I\BB_z(x,y)/\sqrt{\mu\epsilon}$ is required by construction to commute with $\zcap$, but is otherwise arbitrary, except perhaps for boundary value constraints not considered here.

Removing the restriction to fixed wave number and angular velocity we can integrate over both to express a more general transverse wave propagation

\begin{align}\label{eqn:waveguideRetardedAdvanced:foo8}
F_t &= \int d\omega e^{-i\omega t} \int dk e^{ikz} \frac{i}{k^2 - \mu\epsilon\frac{\omega^2}{c^2}} \left(k \zcap + \sqrt{\mu\epsilon}\frac{\omega}{c}\right) \spacegrad_t {F_z}^{k,\omega}
\end{align}

Inventing temporary notation for convenience we write for the frequency dependent weighting function ${F_z}^{k,\omega} = F_z(x,y,k,\omega)$.  Also note that explicit $\pm k$ has been dropped after allowing wave number to range over both positive and negative values.

Observe that each of these integrals has the form of a Fourier integral (ignoring constant factors that can be incorporated into the weighting function).  Also observe that the integral kernel has two poles on the real $k$-axis (or real $\omega$-axis).  These can be utilized to evaluate one of the integrals using an upper half plane semicircular contour.  FIXME: picture here.

Assuming that ${F_z}^{k,\omega}$ is small enough at $\infty$ (on the large contour) to be neglected, we have for the integral after integrating around the poles at $k = \pm \sqrt{\mu\epsilon}\Abs{\omega/c}$

\begin{align}\label{eqn:waveguideRetardedAdvanced:foo9}
F_t &= \int d\omega e^{-i\omega t} 
\pi i \left(
\left.
e^{ikz} \frac{i}{k - \sqrt{\mu\epsilon}\frac{\Abs{\omega}}{c}} \left(k \zcap + \sqrt{\mu\epsilon}\frac{\omega}{c}\right) \spacegrad_t {F_z}^{k,\omega}
\right\vert_{k=-\sqrt{\mu\epsilon}\frac{\Abs{\omega}}{c}}
+\left.
e^{ikz} \frac{i}{k + \sqrt{\mu\epsilon}\frac{\Abs{\omega}}{c}} \left(k \zcap + \sqrt{\mu\epsilon}\frac{\omega}{c}\right) \spacegrad_t {F_z}^{k,\omega}
\right\vert_{k=\sqrt{\mu\epsilon}\frac{\Abs{\omega}}{c}}
\right)
\end{align}
