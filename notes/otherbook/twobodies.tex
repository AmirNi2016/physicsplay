Assuming that the initial relative velocities of the two bodies lies along
the line between them this can be treated as a one dimensional problem.

We have two force equations

\begin{align*}
\text{Force on} \quad m_2 &= - G m_1 m_2 (x_2 - x_1)^{-2} = m_2 {x_2}'' \\
\text{Force on} \quad m_1 &=  G m_1 m_2 (x_2 - x_1)^{-2} = m_1 {x_1}''
\end{align*}

Subtraction (scaled) of these two equations leaves an integration problem for a difference of position variable $u = x_2 - x_1$

\begin{align*}
- G (x_2 - x_1)^{-2} (m_1 + m_2)= (x_2 - x_1)'' \\
\implies
- G (m_1 + m_2) \inv{u^2} = u'' \\
\end{align*}

The chain rule can be used for a first elimination of a time derivative

\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dt} = \frac{du}{dt} \frac{d}{du}
\end{align*}

With $k = G(m_1 + m_2)$, this is

\begin{align*}
\frac{du}{dt} \frac{d}{du} \left(\frac{du}{dt}\right) &= -k u^{-2}
\end{align*}

Introducing a difference of position "velocity" the LHS of this is

\begin{align*}
\frac{du}{dt} \frac{d}{du} \left(\frac{du}{dt}\right)
&= v \frac{dv}{du} \\
&= \frac{d}{du} \left( \inv{2}v^2 \right) \\
\end{align*}

So now we have something that can be directly integrated:

\begin{align*}
\inv{2}v^2 &= k \inv{u} + \inv{2}C
\end{align*}

Fixing the constant in terms of the initial position and speed this is

\begin{align}\label{eqn:velocity}
\frac{du}{dt} &= \pm \sqrt{v_0^2 + 2 G M \left(\inv{u} - \inv{u_0}\right)}
\end{align}

and we can integrate for the time

\begin{align*}
\delta t &= \pm \int_{u_0}^{u_1} du \left(v_0^2 + 2 G M \left(\inv{u} - \inv{u_0}\right)\right)^{-1/2}
\end{align*}

The integral here is of the form

\begin{align*}
\int \frac{\sqrt{u}}{\sqrt{u + \alpha}} du
\end{align*}

and now it's time to pull out the table of integrals, and put in some numbers.

More interesting than the numbers themselves is to think through the physical meaning for the $\pm$.  It makes sense in the velocity equation \ref{eqn:velocity} since the particles can be initially moving towards or away from each other (or stationary).  However, do negative time "solutions" indicate the particles can never converge to the desired separation?
