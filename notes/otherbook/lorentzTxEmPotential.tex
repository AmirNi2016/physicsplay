\section{Motivation.}

Explore the relationships between proper velocity and current density.

\citep{goldstein1951cm} has a combined Lagrangian for the field and Lorentz force:

\begin{align*}
\LL = \int \left\{ \frac{E^2 - B^2}{8 \pi} - \sum_i q_i \delta(\Br-\Br_i)\left(\phi - \Bv_i/c \cdot \BA\right)\right\} dV + \inv{2} m_i \Bv_i^2
\end{align*}

Where alternate variation of the field, or coordinates produces the field equations or Lorentz equation respectively.

Compare to the covariant Lagrangian for the field and interaction (for metric $+---$)

\begin{align}\label{eqn:lorentz_tx_em_potential:maxlag}
\LL_{\text{field}} &= -\frac{\epsilon_0}{2} (\grad \wedge A)^2 + A \cdot J/c \\
\LL_{\text{interaction}} &= \inv{2} m v^2 + q A \cdot (v/c)
\end{align}

(SI units this time).

These can be shown to produce Maxwell's equation and the Lorentz force equation respectively
\begin{align}
\grad F &= J/c\epsilon_0 \\
\pdot &= q F \cdot (v/c)
\end{align}

Derivations of these can be found in \citep{gabook:PJFieldLagrangian}, and \citep{gabook:PJSrLorentzForce} respectively.  

The final aim is
find how to relate the $A\cdot J$, and $q A \cdot v$ interaction quantities in covariant field and
Lorentz Lagrangians.  Intuition tells me that considering the Lorentz transformation of $J$ and $A$ may help
shed some light on this.

Some four potentials discussion perhaps useful as background can be found in \citep{gabook:PJFourPotential}.
