\section{ Motivation. }

For electromagnetism the vector potential equation to solve is

\begin{align*}
\grad (\grad \wedge A) = \frac{J}{c \epsilon_0}
\end{align*}

Imposing a guage condition $\grad \cdot A$ on the solutions $A$, we have

\begin{align*}
\grad^2 A = \frac{J}{c \epsilon_0}
\end{align*}

Which gives us our four scalar potential equations

\begin{align*}
\left(\inv{c^2}\PDsq{t}{} - \sum_k \PDsq{x^k}{} \right) A^0 &= \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} \\
\left(\inv{c^2}\PDsq{t}{} - \sum_k \PDsq{x^k}{} \right) A^i &= \frac{J^i}{c \epsilon_0} \\
\end{align*}

One form of solution for these equations is the retarded time potentials.
Understanding the origin of those solutions 
appears to require Green's functions, and Fourier transforms.



, and 
it appears
hard to find an elementary treatment of that topic.  With the retarded
time solutions and the desired final result, start with consideration
of some simpler linear operators and their solutions.
