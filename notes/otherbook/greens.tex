\section{ Motivation. }

For electromagnetism the vector potential equation to solve is

\begin{align*}
\grad (\grad \wedge A) = \frac{J}{c \epsilon_0}
\end{align*}

Imposing a guage condition $\grad \cdot A$ on the solutions $A$, we have

\begin{align*}
\grad^2 A = \frac{J}{c \epsilon_0}
\end{align*}

Which gives us our four scalar potential equations

\begin{align*}
\left(\inv{c^2}\PDsq{t}{} - \sum_k \PDsq{x^k}{} \right) A^0 &= \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} \\
\left(\inv{c^2}\PDsq{t}{} - \sum_k \PDsq{x^k}{} \right) A^i &= \frac{J^i}{c \epsilon_0} \\
\end{align*}

One form of solution, found for example in \cite{feynman1963flp}
for these equations is the retarded time potentials.  For example, with $\phi = A^0$, the retarded solution for $\phi$ at some time $t$, is expressed as an integral over all space

\begin{align*}
\phi(\Bx, t) &= \inv{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \int \frac{\rho(\Bx', t - \Abs{\Bx-\Bx'}/c)}{\Abs{\Bx - \Bx'}} dV'
\end{align*}

The first time I saw this equation, I was struck by the relativistic nature of the solution.  Only the charges with speed of light separation from the point of interest has an effect on the field at that point.

Unfortunately understanding the origin of those solutions, as covered in
\cite{ FitzRelEandM }, 
appears to require Green's functions, Fourier transforms and a whole mess
of complex seeming stuff.

Intuition tells me that relativistic treatment
of the electrostatics potential solution (ie: Lorentz boosting the Coulomb
statics potential) 
can be used to develop the 
retarded time solutions, and that will be worth a try.  However, it also
appears that direct study of the Green's
function tools will be worthwhile.

These notes will examine topics related to
Green's functions, with the eventual goal of building towards these
retarded time potential solutions.

\section{ Green's functions. }

The basic idea is given a
linear differential operator $\LL$, and the dirac delta function $\delta$, a Green's function solution to the operator equation is

\begin{align*}
\LL G(x,s) = \delta(x-s)
\end{align*}

Using convolution the impulse (delta) function can be used to form
arbitrary driving functions, and the general solution, by superposition
then only requires an equivalent convolution integration.

Examples of possible differential operators are

\begin{align*}
\LL &= \frac{d}{dx} + a \\
\LL &= a \PDsq{x}{} + b \PDsq{y}{} \\
\LL &= \spacegrad^2 - \inv{v^2}\PDsq{t}{}\\
\LL &= \grad^2 \\
\end{align*}

The last of which is the desired operator for the electromagnetism case.

\section{ Solving linear differential equations. }

We don't neccessarily need Green's functions and transform theory explicitly
to solve linear equations.  Lets review some simple cases to see how to 
directly solve some of these.

\subsection{ Simplest case. }

Lets start with solutions of a linear first order equation in one variable.
