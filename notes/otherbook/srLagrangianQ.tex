%\section{}

Yes, $A$ is a vector, and the spacetime basis is $\{\gamma_\mu\}$.

Coordinates representation is done by dotting with the reciprocal frame
vectors satisifying the following:

\begin{align*}
\gamma_\mu \cdot \gamma^\nu = {\delta^\nu}_\mu
\end{align*}

For example for $A$

\begin{align*}
A &= a^\alpha \gamma_\alpha \\
A \cdot \gamma^\beta
&= a^\alpha \gamma_\alpha \cdot \gamma^\beta \\
&= a^\alpha {\delta_\alpha}^\beta \\
&= a^\beta \\
\implies \\
A &= \left(A \cdot \gamma^\alpha\right) \gamma_\alpha \equiv A^\alpha \gamma_\alpha \\
\end{align*}

Similarily, computation of the coordinates in terms of the reciprocal frame
one has

\begin{align*}
A &= \left(A \cdot \gamma_\alpha\right) \gamma^\alpha \equiv A_\alpha \gamma^\alpha \\
\end{align*}

%My view of the tensor form is generally what you get when you drop the basis, looking only at the coordinates.  I've found
%that there's often reasons to temporarily introduce tensor representations, but that they can often be temporary.  Some of the
%calculations I've attempted can probably be done with non-tensor methods, but they aren't too bad once you get used to them.
Using the above coordinate representation $A \cdot \gamma_\mu$ (yes, it's a scalar), can be observed to be:

\begin{align*}
A \cdot \gamma_\mu 
&= \left( A_\nu \gamma^\nu \right) \cdot \gamma_\mu \\
&= A_\nu {\delta^\nu}_\mu \\
&= A_\mu
\end{align*}

I see that I assumed $v$ was understood to be:

\begin{align*}
x &= x^\mu \gamma_\mu \\
v &= \frac{dx}{d\tau} = \xdot^\mu \gamma_\mu
\end{align*}

(that's one of the missing steps to get from $\PD{\xdot^\mu}{A \cdot v}$ to $A \cdot \gamma_\mu$).

Perhaps this makes more sense:

\begin{align*}
%\frac{d}{d\tau}
\PD{\xdot^\mu}{A \cdot v} 
&= \PD{\xdot^\mu}{} A \cdot \xdot^\nu \gamma_\nu \\
&= A \left( \PD{\xdot^\mu}{\xdot^\nu} \right) \cdot \gamma_\nu \\
&= {\delta^\mu}_\nu A \cdot \gamma_\nu \\
&= A \cdot \gamma_\mu \\
\end{align*}

so for the derivative

\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{d\tau} \PD{\xdot^\mu}{A \cdot v} 
&= \frac{d}{d\tau} A \cdot \gamma_\mu \\
&= \frac{d}{d\tau} (A^\nu \gamma_\nu) \cdot \gamma_\mu \\
&= \frac{dA^\nu}{d\tau} \gamma_\nu \cdot \gamma_\mu \\
\end{align*}

You included a nice little box summary of Maxwell's equation in tensor form.  That is pretty much identical to the curl
form, but to see the equivalance the product operations on a wedge are required.  Before mentioning any of that does this
part above now make sense?  I'll revise my notes to try to clarify it.
