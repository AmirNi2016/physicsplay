\section{ Motivation. }

Some General relativity notes exploring ideas from emails with Lut Mentz.
Prior to this I was under the impression that I had zero knowledge of GR,
but it turns out that many of the ideas are really action based. 
Allowing the spacetime unit vectors to vary, something we are free to
do in SR or newtonian mechanics too, results in a more 
general metric in a purely kinetic Lagrangian.  This metric variation
can be interpretted as a mechanism for introducing more general
accererations very similar to fictious forces that one sees in a
rotating frame or other non-uniform coordinate system.

These notes contain my attempt to walk through some of these ideas, to see
if I can coherently explain them to myself.  If I can't do so then I don't
understand things sufficently.  Being able to produce such an explaination
may not mean that I truely understand the issues, but it is a required
first step.

Useful references are Lut's writeup \cite{lutSchwarzChildRadial}, 
and the schwarzchild calculation \cite{mathpagesSchwarzChildRadial}
from the online text reflections on relativity.

FIXME: Ask Lut if he put his Rindler derivation online.

FIXME: Original PF thread and email with Lut was associated with 
a Lagragian where mass was allowed to vary as described in \cite{PJMassVary}.  He was
investigating the similarities between varying mass directly and the spatial/metric
variation of GR.

\subsection{ Lagrangian for General Relativity. }

The equations of motion resulting from a purely kinetic Lagrangian

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:keLagrangian}
\LL = \inv{2} \sum  g_{b c}(q^a) \qdot^b \qdot^c,
\end{equation}

can be found to be

\begin{align}
0
&= \qddot^a + \qdot^b \qdot^c {\Gamma^a}_{b c} \\
{\Gamma^a}_{b c} &= \inv{2} g^{a d} \left( 
\PD{q^b}{g_{c d}} 
+ \PD{q^c}{g_{d b}} 
- \PD{q^d}{g_{b c}} 
\right)
\end{align}

One such derivation can be found in
the solution of problem one \cite{PJTongMf1}, associated with the 
Lagrangian problem set for
Dr. David Tong's online mechanics text \cite{TongDynamics}.

This is the Lagrangian for general relativity, once the metric tensor $g_{a b}$ is specified.

\subsection{ General kinetic Lagrangian for fixed frame basis. }

One doesn't have to go to GR to find Kinetic energy expressions of the form in equation \ref{eqn:keLagrangian}.

A simple example of a more general Kinetic energy description can be found by any use of non-orthonormal basis vectors, say $\{\Be_i\}$,
for the space.

Given such a non-orthonormal frame, the trick to calculating the coordinates is tied to an alternate set of basis vectors, called the reciprocal frame.
Provided the initial set of vectors spans the space, one can always calculate this second pair such that they meet the following relationships:

\begin{equation*}
\Be^i \cdot \Be_j = {\delta^i}_j
\end{equation*}

Calculating these reciprocal frame vectors is a linear algebra problem, essentially requiring a matrix inversion.  Here we just assume they can be calculated and use them as a convienent way to find the coordinates in this non-orthogonal frame

\begin{align*}
\Bx &= \sum \Be_j a_j \\
\Bx \cdot \Be^i &= \sum (\Be_j a_j) \cdot \Be^i = \sum {\delta^j}_i a_j = a_i \\
\implies \\
\Bx &= \sum \Be_j (\Bx \cdot \Be^j)
\end{align*}

It is customary to write $a_i = \Bx \cdot \Be^i = x^i$, in order to have
mixed upper and lower indexes for implied summation.

\begin{equation*}
\Bx = \sum \Be_j x^j = \Be_j x^j
\end{equation*}

Once one has a way of calculating coordinates for an arbitrary basis, other quantities such as velocity
can then be calculated

\begin{equation*}
\Bv^2 = \dot{\Bx} \cdot \dot{\Bx} = (\Be_j \cdot \Be_k) \xdot^j \xdot^k
\end{equation*}

This
$\Be_j \cdot \Be_k$ coefficient of the coordinates
gets a special name, the metric tensor
$g_{j k} = \Be_j \cdot \Be_k$.  It is a symmetric and invertable quantity and can be employed to 
express the Kinetic Energy term of a single particle Lagrangian in the general tensor form 

\begin{equation*}
\inv{2} m \Bv^2 = \inv{2} m g_{j k} \xdot^j \xdot^k
\end{equation*}

Now, in this case $g_{j k}$ is not a function of the coordinates (ie: of position) as in
equation \ref{eqn:keLagrangian}.

\subsection{ General kinetic Lagrangian for a basis frame. }

Now, in the GR case the metric varies (or may) with position.  What do we need to observe this same form in Newtonian
physics?  The immediate thing that comes to mind is the use of a curvalinear basis, where the basis vectors
for a space are allowed to vary direction with position along some path.  Initially that seemed reasonable to
me but for some arbitrary parameterized path, wouldn't the metric then also vary with the path parameterization?  If that
was the case, the Lagrangian in equation \ref{eqn:keLagrangian} does not have the form of a kinetic energy expression.

To resolve this I considered an example.  I can lay out two directions in my backyard, one along the vegetable garden
parallel to the house roughly pointing north, and another diagonally across to my gate.  This logically defines a coordinate
system or set of frame vectors that I can make local measurements with respect to.
Now, translation of this coordinate system
to my dad's house 40 km to the south won't be a particularily logical for measuring there.  He lives on a very 
steep hill.

I can pace out distances in my backyard without having to consider the curvature
of the Earth and my dad can do the same for a long stretch of the hill walking up the street towards his house.
The local frame vectors can be considered to lie along a flat surface if that surface area is small enough.
Alternately we can say the associated metric associated with a surface coordinate system for a point on surface of the Earth can be considered constant for small enough measurements.

Now, to express the same ideas mathematically, consider a curve expressed parametrically between two points, such that all
points along the path take the values

\begin{equation*}
\Bx(\lambda) = x^i(\lambda) \Be_i(\Bx)
\end{equation*}

The vector distance between two points on this path is

\begin{equation*}
\Bx(\lambda_2) - \Bx(\lambda_1) = x^i(\lambda_2) \Be_i(\Bx(\lambda_2)) - x^i(\lambda_1) \Be_i(\Bx(\lambda_1))
\end{equation*}

but this is the direct difference in position between these two points, not the distance along the curve.
To be a true measure of the distance the difference in position has to also be small enough that the frame vectors lie in the same direction at both points to some approximation.

Given such an approximation one can then write
\begin{align*}
\Bx(\lambda_2) - \Bx(\lambda_1) &= \left(x^i(\lambda_2) - x^i(\lambda_1)\right) \Be_i(\Bx) \\
d\Bx &= \frac{d x^i}{d\lambda} \Be_i(\Bx) d\lambda \\
\end{align*}

For such a representation to be valid, the variation of $\Be_i$ at the point $\Bx$ has to be small enough that $\Be_i$ can be 
considered constant.  This is still not a very well defined statement mathematically, and it is not too hard to imagine 
scenerios where it totally fails.  An example is a fractal like curve, something continuous but not differtiable at
any point.

Assuming a sufficently differentiable curve then the distance along the curve between two points can be obtained from the
integral

\begin{align*}
ds
&= \int_{\lambda_1}^{\lambda_2} \sqrt{\left(\frac{d\Bx}{d\lambda}\right)^2} d\lambda \\
&= \int_{\lambda_1}^{\lambda_2} \sqrt{ g_{ i j } \frac{dx^i}{d\lambda} \frac{dx^j}{d\lambda} } d\lambda \\
\end{align*}

Or
\begin{align*}
\left(\frac{ds}{d\lambda}\right)^2 = g_{ i j } \frac{dx^i}{d\lambda} \frac{dx^j}{d\lambda}
\end{align*}

Now, what is the most natural parameterization?  For physical situations time comes to mind, but if the particle stops for a
while on the path, then this derivative goes to zero for a while even if the curve is continuous and has derivatives of all
orders at all points.  Falling back to the most simple curve as a motivator, the circle, 
the natural parameterization is using fractions $\theta$ of the total arc length of the circle $2\pi$.  If the
curve is parameterized by arc length we have

\begin{align*}
\left(\frac{ds}{ds}\right)^2 = 1 = g_{ i j } \frac{dx^i}{ds} \frac{dx^j}{ds}
\end{align*}

%there the natural parameterization is the arc length itself
%Just as in geometry the most natural mathematic parameterization variable is often the arc length itself (


\begin{align*}
t &= t(\lambda) \\
r &= r(\lambda) \\
\Omega &= \Omega(\lambda)
\end{align*}

An element of event arc length will then be

\begin{align*}
ds^2 = \left(\frac{ds}{d\lambda}\right)^2 {d\lambda}^2
&=
\left( -\CC a \left(\frac{dt}{d\lambda}\right)^2 + {b} \left(\frac{dr}{d\lambda}\right)^2 + r^2\left(\frac{d\Omega}{d\lambda}\right)^2 \right) {d\lambda}^2
\end{align*}


\section{ Rindler Metric. }

Lut described the 

\section{ Schwartzchild Metric. } 

Work through the Euler-Lagrange equations for what Lut calls the 
Schwartzchild metric.

\subsection{ Affine Coordinates. }

%\begin{align}
%\CC (d\tau)^2 &= -\CC a(r) (dt)^2 + {b(r)} (dr)^2 + r^2(d\Omega)^2 \\
%a(r) &= 1 - \kappa/r \\
%b(r) &= \inv{a(r)} \\
%\PD{r}{a} &= \kappa/r^2 \\
%\PD{r}{b} &= -\kappa/(r-k)^2 \\
%\adot &= \frac{\kappa \rdot}{r^2}
%\bdot &= \frac{-\kappa \rdot}{(r-k)^2}
%\end{align}

I would interpret the affine coordinates this way.  If we have two ``close'' events described by our $t,r,\Omega$ coordinates, then the path and corresponding
element of arc length between two events can be described parameterically
with an arbitrary parameter $\lambda$

\begin{align*}
t &= t(\lambda) \\
r &= r(\lambda) \\
\Omega &= \Omega(\lambda)
\end{align*}

An element of event arc length will then be

\begin{align*}
ds^2 = \left(\frac{ds}{d\lambda}\right)^2 {d\lambda}^2
&=
\left( -\CC a \left(\frac{dt}{d\lambda}\right)^2 + {b} \left(\frac{dr}{d\lambda}\right)^2 + r^2\left(\frac{d\Omega}{d\lambda}\right)^2 \right) {d\lambda}^2
\end{align*}


Introducing such a natural parameterization with units of time means that we need a dimensional fudge factor, so we write $ds = c d\tau$, so that $\tau$ is the unique parameterization for which $(ds/d\tau)^2 = c^2$.
This implicitly defines the ``proper time'', and we can write our Lagrangian to minimize in terms of that variable

\begin{align*}%\label{eqn:action}
\LL
&= \left(\frac{ds}{d\tau}\right)^2 \\
&= c^2 \\
&= \left( -\CC a \left(\frac{dt}{d\tau}\right)^2 + {b} \left(\frac{dr}{d\tau}\right)^2 + r^2\left(\frac{d\Omega}{d\tau}\right)^2 \right) \\
&= -\CC a \tdot^2 + {b} \rdot^2 + r^2\dotOmega^2 \\
\end{align*}

%Derivatives for $\Omega$
%
%\begin{align*}
%\PD{\Omega}{\LL} &= \left(\PD{\dotOmega}{\LL}\right)' \\
%0 &= (2 r^2 \dotOmega)' \\
%\end{align*}
%
%Observing that $\Omega$ is cyclic, we can write for some constant $A$
%
%\begin{align*}
%\dotOmega = \frac{A}{r^2}
%\end{align*}
%
%From \ref{eqn:action} this provides a relationship between $\rdot$ and $\tdot$
%
%\begin{align*}
%0 = -\CC (a \tdot^2 + 1) + \inv{a} \rdot^2 + A^2/r^2
%\end{align*}
%
%Calculating the derivatives for $t$
%
%\begin{align*}
%\PD{t}{\LL} &= \left(\PD{\tdot}{\LL}\right)' \\
%0 
%&= \left( - 2 \CC a \tdot \right)' \\
%%&= - 2 \CC \adot \tdot - 2 \CC a \tddot \\
%%\implies \\
%%\tddot &= \frac{\kappa \rdot \tdot}{a r^2} \\
%\end{align*}
%
%Again observing that $t$ is cyclic, we can write for some constant $B$
%
%\begin{align*}
%\tdot = B/a
%\end{align*}
%
%Or
%\begin{align*}
%\rdot^2 = \CC ({B^2} + a) - a A^2/r^2
%\end{align*}
%
%Last the derivatives for $r$
%
%%\LL = \CC  = -\CC a \tdot^2 + \inv{a} \rdot^2 + r^2\dotOmega^2
%\begin{align*}
%\PD{r}{\LL} &= \left(\PD{\rdot}{\LL}\right)' \\
%-\CC \PD{r}{a} \tdot^2 - \frac{\adot \rdot^2}{a^2} + 2 r \dotOmega^2 
%&= \left(\frac{2 \rdot}{a}\right)' \\
%&= -2 \frac{ \adot \rdot }{a^2} + \frac{2 \rddot}{a} \\ 
%\implies \\
%{\rddot} 
%&= - \inv{2} \CC \frac{\kappa}{r^2} a \tdot^2 -  \frac{\adot \rdot^2}{2 a} + r a \dotOmega^2 + \frac{ \adot \rdot }{a} \\
%&= - \inv{2} \CC \frac{\kappa B^2}{a r^2} -  \frac{\kappa \rdot^3}{2 a r^2} + a \frac{A^2}{r^3} + \frac{ \kappa \rdot^2 }{a r^2} \\
%\end{align*}
%
%The $\rdot^3$ term doesn't look right dimensionally.
