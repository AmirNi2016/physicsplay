\subsection{ Separate electric and magnetic fields with the boundary conditions unspecified. }

Fixing the boundary value in terms of the initial field at $t=0$ is not the only option.  We see similar things in classical mechanics in constant acceleration problems where one can use an initial position and velocity, or positions at two different times, and so forth.  Bohm leaves his equivalents to the integration constants $C_{\Bk}$ unspecified.  If we do so too we have equation \ref{eqn:undetermined}.  How does that look with separate fields?

FIXME:TODO:...  

Cut and Paste Note.  That referenced equation was:
\begin{align}\label{eqn:undetermined}
F(\Bx,t) = \sum_{\Bk} 
\exp\left(i \Bk c t \right) 
\exp\left(-i \Bk \cdot \Bx \right) 
C_{\Bk} 
\end{align}
