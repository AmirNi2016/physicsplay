- Looks like I have references to bookI content that have to be converted to \citep chapter references.  Check for the reverse as well.
- Added some FIXME's to qm/qmAngularMom.tex.  Review that and qm/bivectorSelect.tex and see if there's an error or just a subtlety that is no longer 
  obvious to me.
- undef references to:

PJStokes1
PJStokes2

I think I moved those to big collection of ... stokes junk collection.
