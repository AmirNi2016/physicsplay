Hi John,

Before talking I just want to let you know where I stand with respect to potential recruitment.

- I'm not actively looking for a new job.  My work at IBM provides a good mix of interesting, challenging, and enjoyability, and believe I am compensated decently.
- I am working part time at IBM, with 80% hours and pay.  IBM gives me the flexibility to take that 20% time off at any time, and I split that time between studies for graduate physics and electrical engineering courses, and time off with my kids when they have holidays.
- I've been taking part time classes at UofT since 2010 with the eventual aim of building up my basic science knowledge enough that I would be employable in a some sort of scientific computing work (but haven't started searching for such work).  If you would like to entertain yourself, I have latex based class notes for many of the courses I have taken and for some self-study available at http://peeterjoot.com/writing/ :)
- I am not currently interested in a job that requires relocation, but assume that is not an issue since it was not also required for Garfield.

I would describe my work at IBM as fairly low level C/C++ systems programming.  Work that I've done includes:

- Threading support in the DB2 unix client library (discovery and cleanup of non-thread safe interface use).
- Ported DB2 to Linux.
- Porting of DB2's engine and test-suite to 64-bit on all platforms.
- Maintenance of and new-features for our operating system services portability layer.  Of that work I was particularly proud of the asynchronous IO abstraction layer that I once implemented, and our lock free reader-writer mutex implementation.
- Compiler, hardware, and operating system feature exploitation.  For example, I wrote (and maintain) our "atomic" interfaces (which predate c++11 std::atomic), using a wide variety of operating system, compiler intrinsics, and small amounts of inline or out-of-line assembly as required.
- Hacking of our build system, and cross component work to improve our internal build speed.  I'm considered fearless when it comes to large scale changes, I've done cross component decoupling work on our header files a number of times that have significantly improved our build times (a loosing but continually useful battle).

For me to seriously look at new employment, I'd have to really like the work I was being offered, be given equal or better time flexibility as I have with IBM (including part time options), plus be compensated well enough to consider the switch.
