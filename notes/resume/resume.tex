\paragraph{Work history}\mbox{ } \\

1997-present. IBM Toronto Lab. Software development for DB2, including

\begin{itemize}
\item Implemented multithread support for DB2¿s Unix client.
\item DB2 Linux porting work and simultaneous reengineering of the Unix portions of our codebase for portability.
\item DB2 64-bit port. This was a project of massive scope, taking our codebase from it¿s 16-bit and 32-bit origins to its current multi-terrabyte consuming state. If you have the RAM we can now eat it.
\item Development and maintenance of DB2¿s internal mutex and atomic implementations, and associated memory ordering mechanisms.
\item Maintenance and implementation of the platform portions of stack collection and other post mortem facilities.
\item Lock-free reimplementation of DB2¿s reader-writer mutex. The performance of our original reader-writer mutex code sucked for a number of reasons (including but not restricted to an exclusive mutex used internally). This was a from scratch implementation where we used a single atomic to track the reader and writer linked lists (indirectly), the reader count, the writer held bit, and a writer reserved bit. This code has stood the test of time and remains one of my proudest products, not only not sucking for performance, but remaining correct despite the massive complexities and range of potential timing holes if done wrong.
\item Implementation of DB2¿s asynchronous IO abstraction layer. It is hard to believe that it was not that long ago that we did all our IO synchronously. This bit of code hides an impressive amount of operating system centric code from our high level development consumers, while squeezing maximum performance from each system.
\item Development and maintenance of many other aspects of DB2¿s operating system abstraction layer.
\item LeadofprojectbranchintegrationteamduringinternaltransitionfromCMVCVCStoclearcase.
\item Ad-hoc build tooling and makefile maintenance as required.
\item Technical owner of DB2¿s coding standards
\item DB2 pureScale project (distributed shared disk database): Implemented various duplexing, failover and reconstruct aspects of the communications between the DB2 engine and the shared buffer pool and lock manager component.
\end{itemize}

Work history prior to 1997 was primarily in construction trades.
