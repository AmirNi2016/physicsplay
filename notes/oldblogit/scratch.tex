A quick before-bed-post-hot-tub thought;)

Had to think what the bivector-trivector commutator produces.

Considering the reverse of the commutator and anticommutators of a bivector $B$ and trivector $T$ we have

\begin{align*}
(B T + T B)^{\tilde{}} &= -(B T + T B) \\
(B T - T B)^{\tilde{}} &= (B T - T B)
\end{align*}

So of the vector, trivector and 5-vector products possible from $BT$ the anticommutator produces the trivector parts, and the commutator is both the vector and five-vector parts (but if we are in a 4D or less space this is just the vector parts).

If your $P_k$s have the relation

\begin{align*}
P_a P_b + P_b P_a = 0
\end{align*}

then it does look like you are after vectors after all (perpendicular ones).
