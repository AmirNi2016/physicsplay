A book on Geometric Algebra applications to electromagnetism.

The target audience are undergraduate student with sufficient background in electromagnetism that knowledge of Maxwell's equations can be presumed.
Alternatives to the usual 3D vector or coordinate based derivations of various problems will be presented that highlight some of the ways that Geometric Algebra can be used to tackle electromagnetic problems.
%the students that come from physics but are still undergraduate. I can possibly introduce some material also to antenna students (just to derive the classical Hertz dipole and magnetic dipole radiation in a (possibly) simpler way).
