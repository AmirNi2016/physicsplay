\makesubproblem{}{problem:gradeselection:3:b}
justify the assertion that \( e^{i \theta} = \cos\theta + i \sin\theta \), where \( theta \) is a scalar angle.

\makesubproblem{}{problem:gradeselection:3:c}
Show that right multiplication of a 2D vector by \( e^{i\theta} \) rotates that vector by \( \theta \) radians.

\makesubproblem{}{problem:gradeselection:3:d}
Does the rotation multivector \( e^{i\theta} \) commute with the 2D basis vectors?
