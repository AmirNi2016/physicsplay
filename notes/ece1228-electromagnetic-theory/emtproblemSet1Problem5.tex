\makeproblem{Helmholtz theorem}{emt:problemSet1:5}{ 
Prove the first Helmholtz's theorem, i.e. if vector \(\BM_1\) is defined by its divergence

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:emtProblemSet1Problem5:20}
\spacegrad \cdot \BM_1 = s
\end{dmath}

and its curl
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:emtProblemSet1Problem5:40}
\spacegrad \cross \BM_1 = \BC 
\end{dmath}

within a region and its normal component \( \BM_{1\txtn} \) over the boundary, then \( \BM_1 \) is 
uniquely specified.

Note: Assume there is a vector \( \BM_2 \) with its divergence and curl equal to \( s \) and \( \BC \)
respectively, then show that \( \BM_1 = \BM_2 \) .
