\makeproblem{Electric field across dielectric boundary.}{emt:problemSet3:3}{ 
The plane \( 3x + 2y + z = 12 \) [\si{m}] describes the interface between a dielectric and free space.
The origin side of the interface has \( \epsilon_{rl} = 3 \) and \( \BE_1 = 2 \xcap + 5 \zcap \) [\si{V/m}]. What is \(\BE_2\)
(the field on the other side of the interface)?
