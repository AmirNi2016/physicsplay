\makesubproblem{}{emt:problemSet8:2a}
Give the TE transmission function \( T^{\textrm{TE}}(\omega) \) for a slab of
length \( d \) with permittivity and permeability \( \epsilon_2, \mu_2 \), surrounded
by medium characterized by \( \epsilon_1 \)
and \( \mu_1 \)
as shown in \cref{fig:ps8:ps8Fig2}.

Make sure you provide the expressions for the terms appearing in the transmission function \( T^{\textrm{TE}}(\omega) \).

\makesubproblem{}{emt:problemSet8:2b}
Suppose medium (II) is a meta-material with \( \epsilon_2 = -\epsilon_1 \)
and \( \mu_2 = -\mu_1 \), where \( \epsilon_1 > 0 \) and \( \mu_1 > 0 \).
What is the transmission function \( T^{\textrm{TE}}(\omega) \) in this case. Express your results in terms
of the propagation constant in medium (I), i.e. \( k_{1z} \).

\makesubproblem{}{emt:problemSet8:2c}
Now consider a source located at \( z=0 \) generating
a uniform plane wave, and for simplicity suppose a one-dimensional propagation. 
What is the field at the second interface \(z=2d\). What is the meaning of your results?
