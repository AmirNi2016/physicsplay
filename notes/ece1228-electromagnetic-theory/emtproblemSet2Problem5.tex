\makeproblem{Point charge.}{emt:problemSet2:5}{ 
\makesubproblem{}{emt:problemSet2:5a}
Consider a point charge \( q \). Using Maxwell equations, derive an expression for the
electric field \( \BE \) 
generated by \( q \) at the distance \( \Br \) from it.  Clearly express your
assumptions and justify them.
\makesubproblem{}{emt:problemSet2:5b}
Derive an expression for the force experience by the charge \( q' \) located at distance \( \Br \)
from the charge \( q \). (This is called Coulomb force)
\makesubproblem{}{emt:problemSet2:5c}
Derive an expression for the electrostatic potential \( V \) at the distance \( \Br \) from the
charge \( q \) with respect to the electrostatic potential at infinity. For convenience, set the
value of electrostatic potential at infinity to zero.
