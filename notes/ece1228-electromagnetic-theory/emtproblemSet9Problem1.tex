\makeproblem{Finite length photonic crystal.}{emt:problemSet9:1}{ 

Consider a truncated (finite length) one dimensional photonic crystal shown in \cref{fig:finitePhotonic:finitePhotonicFig1} below,
in which there are \( N \) dielectric slabs of index \( n_j \) 
and length \( d_j \). Find the transmission and reflection functions for this structure as a function of
\( \lambda_1 \),
\( \lambda_2 \),
\( a \),
\( b \),
\( g \)
and 
\( \beta_i \), where
\( \lambda_1 \) and
\( \lambda_2 \)
are the
eigenvalues of the one period matrix \( \BM \) given in problem 3 of last week and 
\( a \),
\( b \),
\( c \),
and
\( \beta_i \)
are also defined in the same problem.
