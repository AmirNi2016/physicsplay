\makeproblem{Conductor charge distribution on surface.}{emt:problemSet4:4}{ 
We have stated that the boundary condition for a perfect conductor is such that there is
no electric field or charge distribution inside of the conductor. Here we will study the
dynamics of this process. Start with continuity equation
\( \spacegrad \cdot \BJ = -\PDi{t}{\rho} \), where \( \BJ \) 
is the
current density [\si{A/m^2}] and \( \rho \) is the charge density [\si{C/m^3}]. Show that a charge (charge
density) placed inside a conductor will decay in an exponential manner.
