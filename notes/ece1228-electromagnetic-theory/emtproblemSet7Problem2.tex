\makeproblem{Spherical wave solutions.}{emt:problemSet7:2}{ 
Suppose under some circumstances (e.g. \(\mathrm{TE}^r\)
or \(\mathrm{TM}^r\) modes), the partial differential equations
for the wavefunction \( \psi \)
can further be simplified to \( \spacegrad^2 \psi(r, \theta, \phi) = - \beta^2 \psi(r, \theta, \phi) \)
Using 
separation of variables \( \psi(r, \theta, \phi) = R(r) T(\theta) P(\phi) \),
find the differential equations governing the
behavior of \( R, T, P \).  Comment on the differential equations found and their possible solutions.
\paragraph{Remarks}: To have a more uniform answer, making it easier to mark the questions, use the
following conventions (notations) in your answer. 


\begin{itemize}
\item Use \( -m^2 \) as the constant of separation for the differential equation governing \( P(\phi) \).
\item Use \( -n(n+1) \) as the constant of separation for the differential equation governing \( T(\theta) \).
\item Show that \( R(r) \) follows the differential equation associated with spherical Bessel or Hankel functions. 
\end{itemize}
