\section{Appendix I.  Helpful identities.}

This result was used in problem 3 and 6.

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:emtProblemSet1Appendix:460}
\spacegrad \cross \lr{ \spacegrad \cross \BA }
=
\epsilon_{a b c} \Be_a \partial_b \lr{ \epsilon_{r s t} \Be_r \partial_s A_t }_c
=
\epsilon_{a b c} \Be_a \partial_b \epsilon_{c s t} \partial_s A_t
=
\delta_{ab}^{[st]}
\Be_a \partial_b \partial_s A_t
=
\Be_a \partial_b \lr{ \partial_a A_b - \partial_b A_a }
=
\spacegrad \lr{ \spacegrad \cdot \BA } - \spacegrad^2 \BA.
\end{dmath}

%\section{Appendix II.  Geometric Algebra.}
%
%I initially used Geometric Algebra in my solution to problem 5, some of which was somewhat advanced.  As noted in my submission of that problem, that original solution (and one other Geometric Algebra approach) is included below for reference.
%This appendix 
%provides an overview of Geometric Algebra in order to allow the reader to make some sense of those two attempts at problem 5.
