\makeproblem{Meissner effect.}{emt:problemSet6:1}{ 
The constitutive relation for superconductors in weak magnetic fields can be macroscopically
characterized by the first London equation

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:emtproblemSet6Problem1:20}
\PD{t}{\BJ_{\mathrm{sup}}} = \alpha \BE,
\end{dmath}

and the second London equation
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:emtproblemSet6Problem1:40}
\spacegrad \cross \BJ_{\mathrm{sup}} = -\alpha_1 \BB,
\end{dmath}
where \( \BJ_{\mathrm{sup}} \)
stands for the superconducting current, 
\( \alpha = n_s q^2 /m \) and \( \alpha_1 \approx \alpha \), with 
\( n_s \), \(m\), and \( q\) 
denoting, respectively, the number density, the effective mass, and the charge of the Cooper pairs
responsible for the superconductivity in a charged Boson fluid model.

\makesubproblem{}{emt:problemSet6:1a}
From the first London equation, derive and equation for \( \dot{\BB} = \PDi{t}{\BB} \) 
by using the static
Maxwell equation \( \spacegrad \cross \BH = \BJ_{\mathrm{sup}} \)
without the displacement current. Show that
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:emtproblemSet6Problem1:60}
\spacegrad^2 \dot{\BB} = \mu_0 \alpha \dot{\BB}
\end{dmath}
\makesubproblem{}{emt:problemSet6:1b}
From the second London equation and the Ampere's law stated above derive an equation
for \( \BB \).
\makesubproblem{}{emt:problemSet6:1c}
What are the penetration depths in the 
\partref{emt:problemSet6:1a}
and
\partref{emt:problemSet6:1b}
cases? Justify your answer.

\paragraph{Remark:} from above analysis we see that both the current and magnetic field are confined to a
thin layer of the order of the penetration depth which is very small. The exclusion of static
magnetic field in a superconductor is known as the Meissner effect experimentally discovered in
1933.
