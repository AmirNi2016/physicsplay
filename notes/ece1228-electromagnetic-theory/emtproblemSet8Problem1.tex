\makeproblem{Fresnel TM equations.}{emt:problemSet8:1}{ 
For the geometry shown in \cref{fig:ps8:ps8Fig1}, obtain the TM (E) 
Fresnel reflection and transmission coefficients. Express your
results in terms of the propagation constant \( k_{1z} \) and
and \( k_{2z} \),
(i.e., the projection of 
\( \Bk_1 \) and 
\( \Bk_2 \) 
along z-direction.) Note that the
interface is at \( z=0 \) plane.
