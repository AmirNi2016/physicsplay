\makeproblem{Duality theorem.}{emt:problemSet4:3}{ 
Prove that if the time-harmonic fields \( \BE(\Br) \) and \( \BH(\Br) \)
are solutions to Maxwell's
equations in a simple, source free medium ( \( \BM_i = \BJ_i = \BJ_c = 0, \rho_{mv} = \rho_{ev} = 0 \) ),
characterized by \( \epsilon, \mu \) ; then
\( \BE'(\Br) = \eta \BH(\Br) \) and
\( \BH'(\Br) = -\frac{\BE(\Br)}{\eta} \)
are also solutions of
the Maxwell equations. 
\( \eta \)
is the intrinsic impedance of the medium.
\paragraph{Remark}: By showing the above you have proved the validity of the so called duality
theorem.
