\makeproblem{Dipole moment density for disk.}{emt:problemSet2:4}{ 
A dielectric circular disk of radius \( a \) and thickness \( d \) is permanently polarized with a
dipole moment per unit volume \( \BP \) [\si{C/m^2}], where \( \Abs{\BP} \) 
is
constant and parallel to the disk axis (z-axis here) as
shown in \cref{fig:problemset2:problemset2Fig3}.

\imageFigure{../../figures/ece1228-emt/problemset2Fig3}{Circular disk geometry.}{fig:problemset2:problemset2Fig3}{0.3}

\makesubproblem{}{emt:problemSet2:4a}
Calculate the potential along the disk axis for \( z > 0 \).
\makesubproblem{}{emt:problemSet2:4b}
Approximate the result obtained in \partref{emt:problemSet2:4a} for the case
of \( Z \gg d \).
