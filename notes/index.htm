Peeter's Math and Physics Play Notes.

<p>Peeter Joot. peeter.joot@gmail.com </p>

<p>Last year I pulled out some of my old texts and started playing with the math and physics that I liked so much back in school. I find it helpful, albeit time consuming, to type up my scribblings in latex. If I can't explain what I am doing to myself then I usually don't understand something. </p>

<p>Here's my collected Latex notes on various topics. I'm collecting them here to organize them for myself, since I’ve now got enough of these little relatively self contained docs that when I go looking for my notes on something I sometimes have to search a bit.</p>

<p>I may have some explainations here on some topics that others may find helpful, but not being in a school context I don’t really know anybody specifically to tell about what I’ve done. </p>

<p>Note that there is a focus on Geometric Algebra and its physics applications here since that is the current focus of what I am studying (it seems to me a natural fit for E&amp;M and relativity).  Some of these notes are my clarifications for myself on subsets of the texts I was working with, and may not be entirely clear without those texts.</p>

<a href="geometric_algebra/spacetimegrad.pdf">Lorentz transformation of spacetime gradient</a>
</p>

<p>Having expressed the spacetime gradient with a (STA) Minkowski basis, and knowing that Maxwell’s equation written using the spacetime gradient is Lorentz invariant, we therefore expect that the square root of the wave equation (4-Laplacian) operator is also Lorentz invarient. Here this idea is explored, and we look at how the spacetime gradient behaves under Lorentz transformation.</p>

<a href="geometric_algebra/ga_maxwell.pdf">Geometric Algebra: Back to Maxwell’s equations</a>
</p>

<p>A step back and look at Maxwell’s equations in more detail. In particular looking at how we get from integral to differential to GA form.  I had a version of this earlier (below) that I was unsatisfied with, but that one is perhaps more natural if just getting the feel for the algebra.</p>

who couldn’t understand my GA approach.  My intention was just to provide a hint, but he didn’t have enough math background to use this hint for his own derivation.</p>

<a href="tensor/tensor.pdf">Covariant derivative and tensor notes.</a>
</p>

<p>My notes on tensors and index notation, to try to clarify the references to this in “Geometric Algebra for Physicists” (GAFP).  That text uses the upper and lower index notation but assumes in many ways that it is already known to the reader.  This is an attempt to clarify for myself some of the notation and details missing in that text, where the focus is on the coordinate free approach.</p>

<a href="geometric_algebra/lorentz.pdf">A derivation of the Lorentz transformation from wave equation.</a>
</p>

<p>There are some subtleties to understand what it means for the speed of light to be constant.  I cannot say definitively that I still have an satisfactory or intuitive feel for such this constancy.  I think it is easier to to conceptualize the idea that light (ie: an electrodynamic field) is wavelike regardless of the motion of the observer.  Specifically, that light must satisfy the wave equation (ie: Maxwell’s equations) regardless of the space and time parameterization.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This little doc (which I am pleased with) presents a derivation of the Lorentz transformation using the wave equation.  This approach does requires a bit more math than the typical expanding light shell method, but is possibly more intuitive.  I’m curious if somebody else also new to the subject of relativity would agree?</p>

<a href= "maxwell/lorentz_rotation.pdf">Solving Lorentz Force Differential Equation.</a>
</p>

<p>My attempt to answer a PF thread about how to solve the Lorentz force equation.  Used the classical mechanics ideas from Tong’s rigid body treatment.  I don’t think that I really followed this to its complete conclusion, but would like to first understand the relativistic treatment of the same problem in both the GAFP and NFCM books (but that will take considerably more study before I’m capable of understanding that stuff).</p>

<a href= "geometric_algebra/gradient_and_forms.pdf">Exterior derivative and chain rule components of the gradient</a>
</p>

<p>Components of the gradient tangential and dual to a curve is calculated.  I think this is a cool little result, as it appears to show the chain rule and exterior derivative both hiding in the gradient.  If I actually could follow the differential forms books that I have it probably wouldn’t seem like much of a big deal since I expect that subject shows how all this sort of stuff fits together in its natural context.</p>

<p>Perform the proof of the identity to reduce certain forms of triple wedge products to dot product form.  This follows the hint on how to do this in NFCM (not really detailed fully there).</p>

<p>March 21, 2008
<a href= "geometric_algebra/reciprocal_frame.pdf">Reciprocal Frame Vectors</a>
</p>

<p>The reciprocal frame vector concept is extremely powerful, and the way too dense and short treatment of this in the GAFP book isn’t sufficient to learn from in my opinion.  Here are my notes on this which are more thorough and dumb than the GAFP book.  Despite the treatment in that book being so short it has a rather fundamental place in much of the notation used later in the book (like all the index upper and lower notation).  Perhaps this isn’t well covered in their book because they assume familiarity by virtue of having seen this in the context of tensor algebra.  There appear to be enough people thoroughly confused by the tensor notation and covariant and contravarient nomenclature that I think this formulation in terms of simple vector operations well justified.  It also makes it easier to understand the more complex tensors.  An example is the electromagnetic field tensor which we later see to be a coordinate description of a bivector.</p>

<a href= "geometric_algebra/angle_between_line_and_plane.pdf">Angle between line and plane.</a>

<a href= "geometric_algebra/ga_grade_dot_wedge.pdf">An attempt to intuitively introduce the dot, wedge, cross, and geometric products</a>
</p>

<p>This (and the Pythagorus note below that I intended to incorporate into this) was related to this attempt by me to write up a good justification and introduction of the GA products from scratch in a natual way.  Turns out that the GASC book ended up covering this so well I didn’t bother with this little project after purchasing that.</p>

</p>

<p>Here I play with the use of exponentials with multivector arguments.  Split this out from the laplace notes below for clarity.</p>

<p>Some of the bivector treatment below expanded to trivectors.</p>

<p>March 5, 2008
<a href= "geometric_algebra/bivector.pdf">Bivector Geometry.</a>
</p>

<p>Looking at multivector exponential values in the context of the Laplace equation generated some bivector products that warranted understanding the general properties of how these multiply.  In particular vector vector products are well covered in the texts (GAFP, NFCM), but other higher order products are covered in much less detail.  Some of the questions that I had when writing up these notes led to the purchase of the book “Geometric Algebra for Computer Science” (GASC).  That book, which has by far the best introduction to the subject to be had, ended up covering much of the material I felt missing in the other texts.  Much of that missing detail I had worked myself by the time I had received that book, but it was still a very worthwhile read.  Later I found the 
<a href="http://staff.science.uva.nl/~fontijne/phd/fontijne_phd.pdf">
PhD thesis
</a>
by one of the authors which contains much of that text, and is just as readable as the book.   If you want a good intro to the subject before purchasing any texts, give that thesis a read.  I find a book much easier to read than a computer screen, but this particular book uses a different notation than all the others, which is distracting, so you can get an idea of some of the content before a purchase by looking at the thesis.  An additional great resource for learning GA is their interactive graphical GA calculator

</a>
, and their 
<a href="http://www.science.uva.nl/ga/tutorials/">

</a>
which uses it.</p>

<p>Covered in these particular notes are:</p>

<p>All types of products of bivectors (scalar, bivector, and quadvector), how these are related to symmetric and antisymetric decompositions when possible.</p>

<p>Intersection of planes, and relation to duals.</p>

<p>Action of the grade two term of a bivector product as a rotation.  Projection and rejection.</p>

<p>Angle between intersecting planes.</p>

<p>Rotation of a plane.</p>

<p>Bivector products compared to dot product of cross product expressions from traditional R^3 vector algebra.</p>

<a href= "geometric_algebra/rotor.pdf">Rotor Notes.</a>
</p>

<p>Again, reading one of the GAFP or NFCM books I found the treatment of rotors lacking many details that somebody dumb like me needed to understand them from just reading.  Here was my notes on the use of Rotors.  Rotors are two sided rotation operators that generalize complex exponentials and quaternions as rotation operators, and act on vectors or multivectors.</p>

</p>

<p>Having purchased “New Foundations for Classical Mechanics” by Hestenes, I made more a more detailed exposition of the formula for a plane and hyperplanes than covered in the book (which covered the same stuff for a line in much more detail).  These notes include planar and hyperplanar rejection, and components within and dual to that space.</p>

<a href= "geometric_algebra/radial_vector_derivatives.pdf">Radial components of vector derivitives.</a>
</p>

<p>This and the other October docs below are all based on very ad-hoc notes I dumped into the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_algebra">
Wikipedia Geometric algebra page
</a>
, which had very little actual content in it.  As I tried to learn GA from the much too advanced treatments I found on the web, I put my notes in the wiki as I puzzled things out myself.  Eventually I bought some books and if I had done so earlier, I wouldn’t have needed to figure out a lot of this on my own.   It was however time well spent as I learned things more thoroughly trying to figure it out from the basic properties.  I wanted to add details to the wiki pages that didn’t really fit with a wiki page, or were hard to do with wiki markup compared to latex, so eventually I stopped trying to make my notes in wiki and just typed them up directly here.  I never did go back and see if there was anything extra that I added to these that would be worth re-adding to the wiki pages.  What I have here is all based on my wiki page additions (and I was the only contributor at the time), and excludes the minimal bits that were there previously.</p>

<a href= "geometric_algebra/maxwells_ga.pdf">Maxwell’s equations expressed with Geometric Algebra.</a>
</p>

<p>Taking the hint that Maxwell’s equations could be expressed naturally using GA.  I didn’t get it as far as the GAFP book since I didn’t see how to also formulate the spacetime gradient in the STA basis.  This is probably a treatment that can be understood without too much GA prep.</p>

<p>Basic identities, and comparisions to non GA formulations.  Wedge vs. Cross.  Norm using GA square compared equivalent dot product method.  Lagrange identity in cross and wedge product form.  Determinant bivector and cross product expansions.  Cross and wedge product formula for planes.  Projection and rejection.  Parallelogram area, and parallopiped volume.  Vector angle.  Vector inversion.  Symetric and antisymetric product representations of dot and wedge products.  Reversion.  Complex numbers.  Rotation in arbitrary plane.  Cross product as wedge dual.</p>

<a href= "geometric_algebra/ga_wiki_cramers.pdf">Cramer’s rule using wedge products.</a>
</p>

<p>An example showing how Cramer’s rule is just a special case of linear equation solution using the wedge product.  Hestenes uses examples like this in his book.  Without using GA, 


<a href= "http://www.grassmannalgebra.info/grassmannalgebra/book/index.htm">the grassman algebra book</a>

also has a worked example of this which is nice.  I find the GA approach is easier to understand than the Grassman book approach.  The grassman book avoids the dot product to use the metric free regressive product approach.  I find the explicit use of the metric and associated dot product in GA more naturally when trying to bridge from traditional vector identities to a wedge product treatment.</p>

<p>May 10, 2007
<a href= "cross/cross.pdf">The cross product in three and more dimensions</a>
</p>

<p>Revisiting my cross product treatment, but after discovering differential forms and the wedge product (Harley Flanders.  “Differential forms and Applications to the Physical Sciences”).  This was curtosy of Tor who was smart enough to search for it. </p>

<p>I had trouble with relating the wedge product on differential quantities to vectors.  I could see this was related to my old attempt to generalize the vector dot product.  I went back to my old notes and tried to lead from those ideas to the wedge product in a natural way.</p>

<p>This doc contains a few interesting bits. </p>

<p>A coordinate description of vector rejection (difference from projection) in terms of determinants is developed.  This provides a way to calculate the normal component of a vector with respect to a spanning set.</p>

<p>This is used to calculate the area and volume of an N dimensional hyper-parallelogram, or hyper-parallopiped.</p>

<p>Also included is a calculation of a general normal to a set of vectors based on Null space calculation.  Of particular interest is the description of the case when such a normal cannot necessarily be unambiguously defined.</p>

<p>The ideas here are then used to try to intuitively introduce the wedge product and a dot product on pairs of wedge products, without also introducing differentials.  The wedge product and the normal and rejection concepts are all related by the determinant (in fact the determinant really ought to be viewed as generated by the wedge product).</p>

<p>I end with an poor attempt to introduce differential forms for geometric area and volume elements.  When attempting to find a treatment of differnential forms that I could understand I ended up discovering Geometric Algebra.  That subject has exactly what I was looking for as the “answer” for all this generalized vector algebra.  Due to the time required to study that algebraic toolbox I have not yet gotten back to the differential forms that started me down that path.  Soon I hope.</p>

<p>March 25, 2000
<a href= "maxwell/maxwell.pdf">Various formulations of Maxwell’s equations.</a>
</p>

<p>Integral and differential forms of Maxwell’s equations in differential, and integral form, as well as explicit normal and tangential form (as in my Dad’s old 1960s Encyclopedia Britanica).  Derivation of the wave equation in free space and in presence of matter using the normal triple cross product vector relation identity method.  Followup with a four vector complex number treatment that puts the equations in a much more symmetrical form, that highlights the complex number factor that is naturally associated with the magnetic field. </p>

<p>I later followed up on this idea of complex representation in more detail in an email to Tor (at which point I got excited about it and wondered why this wasn’t in all the E&amp;M books since it was so simple and natural and appropriate seeming).  I should dig up and write that up since it would be a nice bridge to the GA ideas.</p>

<p>Circa ~1999
<a href= "cross_1_15/cross_1_15.pdf">Old cross product generalization musings.</a>
</p>

<p>The three dimensionality (and even non-2 dimensionality) of the cross product always bugged me.  I never saw any hint (or if I did I didn’t recognize it) about existing generalizations or degeneralizations of the cross product, even with four years of Engineering classes.  So, one day I felt like “mathing” as my wife and kids call now it, and played with generalizing it.</p>

<p>Starting point was looking at torque in a plane (aka: Feynman Lectures, Vol I), and considering the work done by an incremental rotation, then doing the same for three dimensions.  You end up with the cross product as an operator, and it takes the form of a completely antisymmetric matrix.  I now know that this naturally expresses the antisymmetry of the wedge product (ie: cross product as the dual of a bivector).</p>

<p>In these notes I attempted to take this cross product operator form and extract some of the structure.  In particular I factored this antisymmetric matrix into the product of diagonal and permutation product matrixes, and tried to use that as a way to define a generalized cross product.  I was able to create a 4D cross product generalization in matrix form that had at least some of the 3D cross product properties (and properties of the 2D de-generalization of the cross product).  However, the core problem here is that one doesn’t know how to define the normal that is intrinsic to the cross product, so the whole approach is kind of busted.</p>

<p>After starting with generalizing the cross product using incremental rotation as a starting point, I went back to the other starting point in the cross product definition, where the cross product is defined in terms of Euclidean normal vector properties (where one such orientation of the general normal between two vectors is picked).</p>

<p>There is a final attempt to generalize this further to 5D, but I don’t think I did a particularily good job at it.  The most notable issue is that the 4D version wasn’t really well defined, and worse, I invented a 4D cross product generalization that I didn’t know any applications for.</p>

<p>Perhaps even worse than inventing a cross product generalization for was that I spent a bunch of time working out stuff that others had already figured out much more completely than I, and I didn’t go looking to see what others had done first to ensure I wasn’t (badly) reinventing the wheel.  My friend 
<a href="http://www.ece.ubc.ca/~aamodt/">
Tor Aamodt
</a>
(Prof at UBC), says this is one of the biggest reasons that grad students have thesis advisors.  If I had stayed in school and done this in an academic context I would have had the good fortune to have somebody help point out that I was wasting time.</p>

<p>The final bits in this (long) set of notes was as far as I went with these ideas for quite a while and ended up dropping math as a hobby again for a number of years.</p>
