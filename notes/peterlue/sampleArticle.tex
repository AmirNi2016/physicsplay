% comments start with percent characters.
% every latex doc starts with a document class.  This is a common one:
\documentclass{article}

% Here's an optional package:
\usepackage{amsmath}
% (it is used in this sample for \begin{align}...\end{align} (multi-line equations).)

% optional:
\author{who am I}

% every latex document has a \begin{document} ... \end{document}
\begin{document}
% if you want a title in the article class you name it this way:
\title{my title}

% With the following command to make it show up:
\maketitle

% you may use sections and subsections in many document classes:
\section{section header one}
\subsection{subsection header one}

Paragraph breaks require a blank line between blocks of text.  Any other white space is ignored.

\section{section header two}
\subsection{subsection header two}

More stuff.

\subsection{subsection header three}

Even more stuff.  Here's some basic math formatting.  Let

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:mysample:10}
p_\mu = m \gamma (c, \mathbf{v}).
\end{equation}

Forming the contraction of the components of this vector with itself we find the expected invariant
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:sampleArticle:30}
\begin{aligned}
p_\mu p^\mu
&= m^2 \gamma^2 (c^2 - v^2) \\
&= m^2 \frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} (c^2 - v^2) \\
&= m^2 c^2.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
% align is used for multi-line equations (with \\ marking line breaks and & marking the portion of the line to line everything up on)
% the asteric used here with align* is for an unnumbered equation.

You can also do inline equations with dollar signs to delimit them like this $p^\mu p_\mu = m^2 c^2$.

We can refer to equations with references like this \ref{eqn:mysample:10}.  You'll need to run pdflatex twice to resolve the equation numbers in the references (you'll see 'There are undefined references' in the log file to tell you to do so).
