\maketitle

Continuing the thread of Schr\"{o}dinger equation motivation, a
peek at relativistic origins for the quantum wave equation will be
made.  In particular, one can get fairly close to the 
potential free Schr\"{o}dinger equation by employing
a small momentum approximation of a relativistic wave equation.

The work of DeBroglie (see translation in \cite{AFkracklauerDeBroglie}) 
that originally inspired the attempt to find a quantum wave equation
relies heavily on special relativity arguments.  
%I've also read (where, cite?) that
Schr\"{o}dinger's initial attempt to formulate a quantum wave equation
was naturally relativisitic, but his initial relativistic formulation 
actually discarded because of the failure to produce calculations in agreement
with atomic spectral measurements.

With relativistic origins for the quantum wave equation how do we end up
with something so manifestly non-relativistic?

It is interesting to note that Pauli, a master of relativity, having
written the definitive encyclopedic article 
\cite{pauli1981tr}
on special and general relativity
as a teenager, introduces the 
Schr\"{o}dinger equation as an relativistic approximation in his
Wave Mechanics text \cite{pauli2000wm}.  The following notes follow Pauli's treatment closely.
%however
%Pauli's preference for using 
%$h$ instead of $\hbar$ is avoided.
%.  The second is an attempt to
%avoid some of the terseness of Pauli's presentation.

\section{Invariant length for an energy momentum four vector}

The Lorentz invariant length of an energy momentum four vector 

\begin{align}
P = (E/c, \Bp)
\end{align}

is given by

\begin{align}\label{eqn:Psquared}
P^2 \equiv \frac{E^2}{c^2} - \Abs{\Bp}^2 = \frac{(m c^2)^2}{c^2}
\end{align}

This invariance has meaning for particles, such as electrons, where $m \ne 0$, but also for photons where $m = 0$.  
Einstein's explaination of the photoelectric effect introduced the concept that light comes in
quantized packets of energy (photons), with photon energy proportional to frequency 

\begin{align}
E = h \nu = \hbar \omega
\end{align}

The relativistic invariance relation (\ref{eqn:Psquared}) implies that there is a cooresponding photon momentum, also
quantized in magnitude, and this is typically written

\begin{align}
\Bp = \hbar \Bk
\end{align}

The magnitudes of the vector $\Bk$ and the frequency $\omega$ are not independent, since by (\ref{eqn:Psquared}) we have

\begin{align}\label{eqn:omegaKsquared}
c^2 \Abs{\Bk}^2 = \omega^2
\end{align}

It is also worth noting that we have the concepts of electromagnetic energy and momentum in the continuous theory of
electromagnetic radiation (ie: Maxwell's equations).  For an electromagnetic wave in vacuum the
field energy density and momentum density also form a four vector

\begin{align}
P = \epsilon_0 \left(\frac{\Abs{\BE}^2}{2} + \frac{c^2 \Abs{\BB}^2}{2}, c \BE \cross \BB \right)
\end{align}

Because $\Abs{\BE}^2 = c^2 \Abs{\BB}^2$, and $\BE \cdot \BB = 0$ for an electromagnetic wave one can show with some vector
manipulation that in this continuous representation of light we also have $P^2 = 0$.

\section{Wave equation solutions to Maxwell's equations}

The equation for a wave $\psi(t,\Bx)$ propagating at the speed of light is 

\begin{align}
\delambertian \psi = \left( \frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2}{{\partial t}^2} - \spacegrad^2 \right) \psi = 0
\end{align}

This is in fact the form that Maxwell's equations for both the electric and magnetic field take in the abscence of charge or currents.
For example we have for the electric field

\begin{align}\label{eqn:eField}
\delambertian \BE = \left( \frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2}{{\partial t}^2} - \spacegrad^2 \right) \BE = 0
\end{align}

If we form the vector valued function

\begin{align}\label{eqn:testSolutionE}
\BE = \BE_0 e^{ i( \Bk \cdot \Bx - \omega t ) }
\end{align}

then application of the wave equation operator produces

\begin{align}\label{eqn:boxApplied}
\delambertian \BE = -\left( \frac{\omega^2}{c^2} - \Abs{\Bk}^2 \right) \BE
\end{align}

Therefore we have a solution of (\ref{eqn:eField}) provided

\begin{align}
\omega^2 = c^2 \Abs{\Bk}^2
\end{align}

This is exactly the relativistic invariance condition (\ref{eqn:omegaKsquared}) for for a photon of energy $\hbar \omega$.

\section{Matter Wave equation}

Suppose that one has a function

\begin{align}\label{eqn:waveFunction}
\psi = e^{ i( \Bk \cdot \Bx - \omega t) }
\end{align}

that in some way represents a matter wave for a particle with energy $E = \hbar \omega$, and momentum
 $\Bp = \hbar \Bk$.  The multiplicative factor has been omitted for clarity.
From (\ref{eqn:boxApplied}), and 
(\ref{eqn:Psquared})
we see that such a function will satisfy the relativistic wave equation

\begin{align}
\delambertian \psi = \left( \frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2}{{\partial t}^2} - \spacegrad^2 \right) \psi = - \frac{m^2 c^2}{\hbar^2} \psi
\end{align}

We have now reached the point that a non relativistic approximation can be made.
Again from (\ref{eqn:Psquared}) we have

\begin{align}
\omega = \frac{m c^2}{\hbar} \sqrt{ 1 + \frac{\hbar^2 \Abs{\Bk}^2}{m^2 c^2}}
\end{align}

If $(\hbar^2 \Abs{\Bk}^2)/(m^2 c^2)$ is small enough, then a first order Taylor gives

\begin{align}
\omega \approx \frac{m c^2}{\hbar} + \frac{\hbar \Abs{\Bk}^2}{2 m}
\end{align}

This allows for a factorization of the wave function (\ref{eqn:waveFunction})

\begin{align}\label{eqn:intermed}
\psi = 
\exp\left( i \frac{m c^2}{\hbar} t \right) 
\exp\left( i \left( 
\Bk \cdot \Bx 
-\frac{\hbar \Abs{\Bk}^2}{2 m}t 
\right) \right)
\end{align}

The infinite plane wave solution of (\ref{eqn:waveFunction}) was only one possible solution to the original wave equation.
A general solution could be any superposition of such solutions, such as a weighted integral over wave numbers (ie: an 
inverse Fourier transform from a wave number representation).  For this reason it is not unreasonable to drop the specific
plane wave nature that generated (\ref{eqn:intermed}) instead writing $\psi(t,\Bx)$ in terms of an unknown function $\psi'$ as follows

\begin{align}
\psi = \exp\left( i \frac{m c^2}{\hbar} t \right) \psi'(t, \Bx)
\end{align}

We are now set to apply the relativistic wave equation operator to the wave function that we have now first order Taylor expanded
around the rest frequency $m c^2/\hbar$

\begin{align}
\delambertian \psi 
= 
\left(
\frac{1}{c^2} 
\left( 
\left( \frac{i m c^2}{\hbar} \right)^2 \psi' - 2 i \frac{m c^2}{\hbar} \frac{\partial \psi'}{\partial t} + 
\frac{\partial^2 \psi'}{\partial t^2} 
\right) 
%\exp\left( i \frac{m c^2}{\hbar} t \right) 
-
\spacegrad^2 \psi' 
\right)
\exp\left( i \frac{m c^2}{\hbar} t \right) 
= - 
\exp\left( i \frac{m c^2}{\hbar} t \right) 
\frac{m^2 c^2}{\hbar^2} \psi'
\end{align}

Rearranging we have 
%\begin{align}
%\frac{1}{c^2} 
%\left( 
%-2 i \frac{m c^2}{\hbar} \frac{\partial \psi'}{\partial t} + 
%\frac{\partial^2 \psi'}{\partial t^2} 
%\right) 
%= 
%\spacegrad^2 \psi' 
%\end{align}

\begin{align}
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \spacegrad^2 \psi' = i \hbar \frac{\partial \psi'}{\partial t} -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \psi'}{\partial t^2} 
\end{align}

Now for the mass of an electron $\hbar^2/(m_e c^2) \approx 10^{-55} m^2 kg$, which is pretty small seeming.

Assuming this last term can be dropped we have the potential free Schr\"{o}dinger's equation.

\begin{align}
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \spacegrad^2 \psi' = i \hbar \frac{\partial \psi'}{\partial t}
\end{align}

Observe that 
this isn't the only wave equation we could construct in this fashion.  For example, starting with $\psi \propto e^{i(\omega t - \Bx \cdot \Bk)}$, also a solution to the wave equation, would produce a similar equation except for an negation of the 
the sign on the time derivative.
