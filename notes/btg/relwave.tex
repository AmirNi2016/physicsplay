\section{Alternative approaches to motivate Schr\"{o}dinger's equation.}

It does not take particularily fancy mathematics to motivate the Schr\"{o}dinger's equation.  In
French and Taylor (\cite{french1998iqp}) the specialization of Schr\"{o}dinger's equation for a 
particle in a one dimensional potential

\begin{align}\label{eqn:oneDimSch}
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial x^2} + V\psi = i \hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}
\end{align}

is presented from start to finish in only seven pages with no mathematics or physics unfamiliar to second year 
engineering undergrads.  However this does include a disclaimer upfront that
``we ... simply try to make the form of the equation plausible''.  The plausibility arguments
found in this text are not uncommon, and can be found for example (without the surrounding discussion of the text) 
in the ``Short heuristic derivation'' of the Wikipedia's Schr\"{o}dinger's equation article (\cite{wikiSchH}).

Calling these derivations is justifably debatable and is perhaps the origin of statements like
``Schr\"{o}dinger's equation cannot be derived'' (\cite{hyperphysicsSch})
Considerable care 
is required to construct logically consistent arguments that motivate the quantum wave
equation in a fashion that is not simply playing the equation in reverse.  Bohm's Quantum Theory
(\cite{bohm1989qt}) contains such a carefully crafted treatment.  The cost 
of this presentation
is that it takes nine chapters and two hundred pages to get to
the starting point of many other introductory Quantum texts.

Perhaps agreeing with a it cannot be derived opinion, the text of Liboff (\cite{liboff2003iqm}) appears to take a 
``let's calculate approach''.  There is little attempt to motivate the equation.  Instead one is left to learn
its characteristics by using it.  This engineering approach has some merits but must also contribute to much of the mystery
and confusion surrounding the subject.

Observe that the form of Schr\"{o}dinger's equation given in (\ref{eqn:oneDimSch}) or its three dimensional generalization is
explicitly non-relativisitic.  Time and space are not treated uniformly.  The order of the derivatives are not
even the same!

Given this apparent non-relativistic nature it is perhaps somewhat suprising that Pauli's Wave Mechanics (\cite{pauli2000wm}),
starts not with the Bohr model, nor black bodies, nor or any of the usual starting points for a Quantum text,
but instead with a lighting fast review of special relativity.
By assuming that the solution of the matter wave equation will take the same functional form as the solution for the classical wave equations
for light, and
by utilizing the
DeBroglie hypothesis that an energy momentum four vector for matter can be quantized, Pauli 
outlines a procedure to obtain a small momentum approximation of a relativistic matter wave equation (ie: of the Klien-Gordon equation).

Comments in
the wikipedia Klien-Gordon article (\cite{wikiKG}), suggest that Pauli's approach is probably closer historically to
the reasoning used initially
by Schr\"{o}dinger.  It is also interesting to note that the thesis of DeBroglie (\cite{AFkracklauerDeBroglie}) which
originally hypothosized extension of the notion of quantized freqencies from light to particles 
also heavily relied on special relativity arguments.

The following discussion follows the brief treatment of Pauli's text, but attempts to fill in some of the in between steps.

\section{Relativity prerequistes.}

From relativistic dynamics the Lorentz length of an energy momentum four vector is required

\begin{align}
E^2/c^2 - \Bp^2 = m^2 c^2
\end{align}

Note that this energy momentum difference is only an invariant when the relativistic definitions of $E$, and $\Bp$
are used
\begin{align}
E \equiv \frac{m c^2}{\sqrt{1 - \Bv^2/c^2}}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
\Bp \equiv \frac{m \Bv}{\sqrt{1 - \Bv^2/c^2}}
\end{align}

\section{Solution of the relativistic wave equation.}

It is a straightforward operation (\cite{fleisch2007ssg}) to put Maxwell's
equations in the abscence of charge and current into wave equation form

\begin{align}\label{eqn:waveE}
\inv{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \BE}{\partial t^2} - \spacegrad^2 \BE = 0
\end{align}
\begin{align}\label{eqn:waveB}
\inv{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \BB}{\partial t^2} - \spacegrad^2 \BB = 0
\end{align}

The six equations of (\ref{eqn:waveE}), and (\ref{eqn:waveB}) have the
appearance of independence, but
any solution must still meet the constraints imposed by Maxwell equations.
For example for a linearly polarized
plane wave one can have $\BB = \kcap \cross \BE$, so the triplet of $\BE$, $\BB$, and $\kcap$ (the propagation direction) form a set 
of mutually perpendicular vectors.

Additional details on the dependence of the electromagnetic wave equations
can be found for example in Jackson (\cite{jackson1975cewWave}).
Fortunately, tackling this in full detail is not required.  

There have been two specific aims discussing Maxwell wave equations (FIXME: SNIPPED THE WAVE EQUATION DERIVATION STUFF).
One has been to provide a real world example of something that propagates with behaviour
governed by the relativistic wave equation.  The other is that we have an understanding 
of light quantization due to the photoelectric effect.  Together these 
will lead eventually to a relativistic matter wave equation and
the non-relativistic approximation that we know of as the 
Schr\"{o}dinger equation.

We can now move on to tackle the mathematical problem of finding solutions to our 
homogeneous wave equation for an arbitrary function $\psi(t,\Bx)$

\begin{align}
%\delambertian \psi(t,\Bx) = 
\left( \frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2}{{\partial t}^2} - \spacegrad^2 \right) \psi(t,\Bx) = 0
\end{align}

Assuming preexisting knowledge of wave equation solutions here is not unreasonable, and nobody who has read this
far 
will likely be suprised that functions of the form $f(ct \pm \kcap \cdot \Bx)$
are solutions to $\delambertian f(t,\Bx) = 0$.  Superposition
of such functions would also be solutions, but general fitting to boundary conditions without additional constraints 
on the functions could be tricky.

An alternate approach is the application of more systematic methods.  In particular, the application 
of Fourier transformations to the wave equation is an effective technique.  As with Fourier solutions of the heat equation
(\cite{osgoodFourier}), performing this sort of transformation on the wave equation will result
in a much simpler differential equation in the wave number domain.

For the 3D spatial Fourier transforms a choice to use the following symmetric form for the 

\begin{align}
\FF(f(\Bx)) = \hat{f}(\Bk) = \inv{(\sqrt{2\pi})^3} \int f(\Bx) \exp\left( -i \Bk \cdot \Bx \right) d^3 x 
\end{align}
\begin{align}
\FF^{-1}({f}(\Bk)) = f(\Bx) = \inv{(\sqrt{2\pi})^3} \int \hat{f}(\Bk) \exp\left( i \Bk \cdot \Bx \right) d^3 k
\end{align}

Application of the Fourier 
transform to the wave equation then yields

\begin{align}
\inv{(\sqrt{2\pi})^3} \int 
\inv{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \psi(t,\Bx)}{\partial t^2}
\exp\left( -i \Bk \cdot \Bx \right) d^3 x 
=
\sum_{m=1}^3 \inv{(\sqrt{2\pi})^3} \int \frac{\partial^2 \psi(t, \Bx) }{\partial {x_m}^2} \exp\left( -i \Bk \cdot \Bx \right) d^3 x 
\end{align}

With the Rigor Police on vacation, we assume that the functions $\psi$ and their derivatives are all sufficiently well behaved that
any changes of integration and differentiation order can be made without getting into trouble, and that the $\psi$ and its derivatives
vanish at infinity (the bounds of the integrals allowing for integration by parts to do nothing more than sign change).

Doing that integration by parts twice on the RHS and interchanging the order of integration and time differentiation on the LHS we have

\begin{align}
\inv{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \hat{\psi}(t,\Bk)}{\partial t^2} = (-i)^2 \Bk^2 \hat{\psi}(t,\Bk)
\end{align}

We see that the wave-number domain equivalent to the spacetime wave equation is a partial differential form of the
harmonic oscillator with solution

\begin{align}
\hat{\psi}(t,\Bk) = B_{\pm}(\Bk) \exp(\pm i c \Abs{\Bk} t)
\end{align}

In particular, the integration constants $B_{\pm}(\Bk)$ are the Fourier transforms of the wave equation taken at $t=0$
\begin{align}
B_{\pm}(\Bk) = \hat{\psi}(0,\Bk) = \inv{(\sqrt{2\pi})^3} \int \psi(0,\Bx) \exp\left( -i \Bk \cdot \Bx \right) d^3 x 
\end{align}

Inverse Fourier transformation provides us with the general time evolution of the wave function given an initial spatial 
specification
\begin{align}
{\psi}(t,\Bx) 
= \inv{({2\pi})^3} \int \psi(0,\Bx') \exp\left( -i \Bk \cdot (\Bx' -\Bx) \pm i c \Abs{\Bk} t \right) d^3 x' d^3 k
\end{align}

Many interesting things can be done with this equation and we ignore most of them here, and instead put the evolutional integration
into a black box, avoiding any explicit statement of the initial conditions.  First write (dropping explicit $\pm$ subscripts) for the
$\Bk$ dependent function of the integral

\begin{align}
A(\Bk) = \inv{({2\pi})^3} \int \psi(0,\Bx') \exp\left( -i \Bk \cdot \Bx' \right) d^3 x'
\end{align}

Then our Fourier solution takes the form
\begin{align}
{\psi}(t,\Bx) = \int A(\Bk) \exp\left( i \Bk \cdot \Bx \pm i c \Abs{\Bk} t \right) d^3 k
\end{align}

(this is roughly the starting point in Pauli's book, where he says "see optics").

\section{first try.}
Continuing the thread of Schr\"{o}dinger equation motivation, a peek at the relativistic origins for the quantum wave equation will be made.

The work of DeBroglie (\cite{AFkracklauerDeBroglie}) used by Schr\"{o}dinger to construct the quantum wave equation as we now know it relied heavily on special relativity arguments.  
Schr\"{o}dinger's initial attempt at the wave equation was in fact relativistic, but he ended up publishing a non-relativistic 
approximation.
According to the wikipedia Klien Gordon page (\cite{wikiKG}),

\subsection{Invariant length for an energy momentum four vector}

The Lorentz invariant length of an energy momentum four vector

\begin{align}
P = (E/c, \Bp)
\end{align}

is given by

\begin{align}\label{eqn:Psquared}
P^2 \equiv \frac{E^2}{c^2} - \Abs{\Bp}^2 = \frac{(m c^2)^2}{c^2}
\end{align}

This invariance has meaning for particles, such as electrons, where $m \ne 0$, but also for photons where $m = 0$.
Einstein's explanation of the photoelectric effect introduced the concept that light comes in
quantized packets of energy (photons), with photon energy proportional to frequency

\begin{align}
E = h \nu = \hbar \omega
\end{align}

The relativistic invariance relation (\ref{eqn:Psquared}) implies that there is a corresponding photon momentum, also
quantized in magnitude, and this is typically written

\begin{align}
\Bp = \hbar \Bk
\end{align}

The magnitudes of the vector $\Bk$ and the frequency $\omega$ are not independent, since by (\ref{eqn:Psquared}) we have

\begin{align}\label{eqn:omegaKsquared}
c^2 \Abs{\Bk}^2 = \omega^2
\end{align}

%It is also worth noting that we have the concepts of electromagnetic energy and momentum in the continuous theory of
%electromagnetic radiation (i.e.: Maxwell's equations).  For an electromagnetic wave in vacuum the
%field energy density and momentum density also form a four vector
%
%\begin{align}
%%P = \epsilon_0 \left(\frac{\Abs{\BE}^2}{2} + \frac{c^2 \Abs{\BB}^2}{2}, c \BE \cross \BB \right)
%\end{align}
%
%Because $\Abs{\BE}^2 = c^2 \Abs{\BB}^2$, and $\BE \cdot \BB = 0$ for an electromagnetic wave one can show with some vector manipulation that in this continuous representation of light we also have $P^2 = 0$.

\subsection{Wave equation solutions to Maxwell's equations}

The coupling between wave number and angular frequency can 
%\begin{align}\label{eqn:omegaKsquared}
The 
In classical electrodynamics there are the field energy and momentum densities can also be are also coupled as in 
The 
%\begin{align}\label{eqn:omegaKsquared}

The equation for a wave $\psi(t,\Bx)$ propagating at the speed of light is

\begin{align}
\delambertian \psi = \left( \frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2}{{\partial t}^2} - \spacegrad^2 \right) \psi = 0
\end{align}

This is in fact the form that Maxwell's equations for both the electric and magnetic field take in the absence of charge or currents.
For example we have for the electric field

\begin{align}\label{eqn:eField}
\delambertian \BE = \left( \frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2}{{\partial t}^2} - \spacegrad^2 \right) \BE = 0
\end{align}

If we form the vector valued function

\begin{align}\label{eqn:testSolutionE}
\BE = \BE_0 e^{ i( \Bk \cdot \Bx - \omega t ) }
\end{align}

then application of the wave equation operator produces

\begin{align}\label{eqn:boxApplied}
\delambertian \BE = -\left( \frac{\omega^2}{c^2} - \Abs{\Bk}^2 \right) \BE
\end{align}

Therefore we have a solution of (\ref{eqn:eField}) provided

\begin{align}
\omega^2 = c^2 \Abs{\Bk}^2
\end{align}

This is exactly the relativistic invariance condition (\ref{eqn:omegaKsquared}) for a photon of energy $\hbar \omega$.

\subsection{Matter Wave equation}

Suppose that one has a function

\begin{align}\label{eqn:waveFunction}
\psi = e^{ i( \Bk \cdot \Bx - \omega t) }
\end{align}

that in some way represents a matter wave for a particle with energy $E = \hbar \omega$, and momentum
 $\Bp = \hbar \Bk$.  The multiplicative factor has been omitted for clarity.
From (\ref{eqn:boxApplied}), and
(\ref{eqn:Psquared})
we see that such a function will satisfy the relativistic wave equation

\begin{align}
\delambertian \psi = \left( \frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2}{{\partial t}^2} - \spacegrad^2 \right) \psi = - \frac{m^2 c^2}{\hbar^2} \psi
\end{align}

We have now reached the point that a non relativistic approximation can be made.
Again from (\ref{eqn:Psquared}) we have

\begin{align}
\omega = \frac{m c^2}{\hbar} \sqrt{ 1 + \frac{\hbar^2 \Abs{\Bk}^2}{m^2 c^2}}
\end{align}

If $(\hbar^2 \Abs{\Bk}^2)/(m^2 c^2)$ is small enough, then a first order Taylor gives

\begin{align}
\omega \approx \frac{m c^2}{\hbar} + \frac{\hbar \Abs{\Bk}^2}{2 m}
\end{align}

This allows for a factorization of the wave function (\ref{eqn:waveFunction})

\begin{align}\label{eqn:intermed}
\psi =
\exp\left( i \frac{m c^2}{\hbar} t \right)
\exp\left( i \left(
\Bk \cdot \Bx
-\frac{\hbar \Abs{\Bk}^2}{2 m}t
\right) \right)
\end{align}

The infinite plane wave solution of (\ref{eqn:waveFunction}) was only one possible solution to the original wave equation.
A general solution could be any superposition of such solutions, such as a weighted integral over wave numbers (i.e.: an
inverse Fourier transform from a wave number representation).  For this reason it is not unreasonable to drop the specific plane wave nature that generated (\ref{eqn:intermed}) instead writing $\psi(t,\Bx)$ in terms of an unknown function $\psi'$ as follows

\begin{align}
\psi = \exp\left( i \frac{m c^2}{\hbar} t \right) \psi'(t, \Bx)
\end{align}

We are now set to apply the relativistic wave equation operator to the wave function that we have now first order Taylor expanded
around the rest frequency $m c^2/\hbar$

\begin{align}
\delambertian \psi
=
\left(
\frac{1}{c^2}
\left(
\left( \frac{i m c^2}{\hbar} \right)^2 \psi' - 2 i \frac{m c^2}{\hbar} \frac{\partial \psi'}{\partial t} +
\frac{\partial^2 \psi'}{\partial t^2}
\right)
%\exp\left( i \frac{m c^2}{\hbar} t \right)
-
\spacegrad^2 \psi'
\right)
\exp\left( i \frac{m c^2}{\hbar} t \right)
= -
\exp\left( i \frac{m c^2}{\hbar} t \right)
\frac{m^2 c^2}{\hbar^2} \psi'
\end{align}

Rearranging we have
%\begin{align}
%\frac{1}{c^2}
%\left(
%-2 i \frac{m c^2}{\hbar} \frac{\partial \psi'}{\partial t} +
%\frac{\partial^2 \psi'}{\partial t^2}
%\right)
%=
%\spacegrad^2 \psi'
%\end{align}

\begin{align}
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \spacegrad^2 \psi' = i \hbar \frac{\partial \psi'}{\partial t} -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \psi'}{\partial t^2}
\end{align}

Now for the mass of an electron $\hbar^2/(m_e c^2) \approx 10^{-55} m^2 kg$, which is pretty small seeming.

Assuming this last term can be dropped we have the potential free Schr\"{o}dinger's equation.

\begin{align}
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \spacegrad^2 \psi' = i \hbar \frac{\partial \psi'}{\partial t}
\end{align}

Observe that
this isn't the only wave equation we could construct in this fashion.  For example, we could also have started with $\psi \propto e^{i(\omega t - \Bx \cdot \Bk)}$.  Provided $\omega^2 = c^2 \Abs{\Bk}^2$ as before, this is still a solution to the wave equation, and this procedure would produce a wave equation with a negated sign on the time derivative.
