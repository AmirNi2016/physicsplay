   - enable \cref for figures in notes collections that I'm not using it.  
      What are those?
   Then convert figure text references to use that in all docs (and move \cref stuff out of thisbook.sty's to peeter_layout.sty).

   used the following too greedy regex:

   %s/figure *( *\\ref\({.*}\) *)/\\cref\1/cg

   search for any remaining \ref{fig:

   grep -n '\\ref{fig:' `cat l`
