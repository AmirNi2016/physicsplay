\makeproblem{Dimensional analysis.}{qft:problemSet1:4}{ 
%\makesubproblem{}{qft:problemSet1:4a}

Even though we have set \( \Hbar = c = 1 \), we can still do dimensional analysis because we still have one unit left, mass (or 1/length). In \( d \) space-time dimensions (1 time and \( d-1 \) space), what is the dimension in mass units of a canonical free scalar field, \( \phi \)? (Work it out from the equal-time commutation relations.) Still in \( d \) dimensions, the Lagrange density for a scalar field with self-interactions might be of the form

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:qftproblemSet1Problem4:n}
\LL = \inv{2} \lr{ \partial_\mu \phi}^2 - \sum_{n \ge 2} a_n \phi^n.
\end{dmath}

What is the dimension (again in mass units) of the Lagrange density? The action? The coefficients \( a_n \)? (as a check, whatever the value of \( d \), \(a_2\) had better have the dimensions of \(\textrm{mass}^2\) ).
