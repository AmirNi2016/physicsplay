These are my personal lecture notes for the Fall 2012, University of Toronto Modern Optics course (PHY485H1F), taught by Prof.\ Henry M. van Driel.

The official description of this course is

This course builds on a student's knowledge of basic electromagnetic theory by focusing attention on light including elementary aspects of the propagation of optical beams and their interaction with matter.  We examine light polarization, coherence, interference and diffraction as we move towards a description of lasers within a semiclassical picture in which the fields are treated classically and matter is treated quantum mechanically.  In between we discuss Gaussian beam modes and their relation to optical resonators as well as fibre and slab waveguides.

The books \cite{hecht2002optics} and \cite{saleh1991fundamentals} are listed as useful references, but are not required texts for the course. 

This document will probably contain a few things

\begin{itemize}
\item My lecture notes.

Typos, if any, are probably mine (Peeter), and no claim nor attempt of spelling or grammar correctness will be made.

\item Some personal notes exploring details that weren't clear to me from the lectures, or from the texts associated with the lecture material.

\item Some worked problems.

\item Links to mathematica workbooks associated with course content.
