This document will probably contain a few things

\begin{itemize}
\item My personal lecture notes for the Fall 2012, University of Toronto Modern Optics course (PHY485H1F), taught by Prof.\ Henry M. van Driel.

Typos, if any, are probably mine (Peeter), and no claim nor attempt of spelling or grammar correctness will be made.

\item Some personal notes exploring details that weren't clear to me from the lectures, or from the texts associated with the lecture material.

\item Some worked problems.

\item Links to mathematica workbooks associated with course content.

\end{itemize}
