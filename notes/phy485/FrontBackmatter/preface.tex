This document is based on my lecture notes for the Fall 2012, University of Toronto Modern Optics course (PHY485H1F), taught by Prof.\ Henry M. van Driel.  

%My thanks to Professor Driel for teaching this course...

Official course description:

This course builds on a student's knowledge of basic electromagnetic theory by focusing attention on light including elementary aspects of the propagation of optical beams and their interaction with matter.  We examine light polarization, coherence, interference and diffraction as we move towards a description of lasers within a semiclassical picture in which the fields are treated classically and matter is treated quantum mechanically.  In between we discuss Gaussian beam modes and their relation to optical resonators as well as fibre and slab waveguides.

The books \cite{hecht2002optics} and \cite{saleh1991fundamentals} are listed as useful references, but are not required texts for the course. 

%What you will find in this document:
This document will probably contain a few things

\begin{itemize}
\item Some personal notes exploring details that weren't clear to me from the lectures, or from the texts associated with the lecture material.

\item Problem sets and midterm solutions.

\item Some worked problems attempted for fun or for exam preparation.

\item Links to Mathematica workbooks associated with course content.

\end{itemize}
