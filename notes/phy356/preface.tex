This document contains a few things

\begin{itemize}
\item My personal lecture notes for the Fall 2010, University of Toronto Quantum mechanics I course (PHY356H1F), taught by Prof.\ Vatche Deyirmenjian.

Typos, if any, are probably mine (Peeter), and no claim nor attempt of spelling or grammar correctness will be made.  The first four lectures I had chosen not to take notes for since they followed the text \cite{desai2009quantum} very closely.

\item Notes from reading of the text.  This includes observations, notes on what seem like errors, and some solved problems.  None of these problems have been graded.

\item Some assigned problems.  I've corrected some the errors after recieving grading feedback, and where I haven't done so I at least recorded some of the grading comments as a reference.

\item Some worked problems associated with exam preparation.

\end{itemize}
