%Review.  What have we learned?

Information about systems comes from vectors and operators.  Express the vector $\ket{\phi}$ describing the system in terms of eigenvectors $\ket{a_n}, n \in 1,2,3,\cdots$ of some operator $A$.

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:PHY356FLecture10:51}
\ket{\phi} = \sum_n c_n \ket{a_n} = \sum_n \ket{c_n a_n}
\end{equation}

What are the coefficients $c_n$?  Act on both sides by $\bra{a_m}$ to find

\begin{align*}
\braket{a_m}{\phi}
&= \sum_n \bra{a_m} \ket{ c_n a_n } \\
&= \sum_n c_n \braket{a_m}{ a_n } \\
&= \sum_n c_n 
\mathLabelBox{\braket{a_m}{a_n}}{Kronicker delta}
\\
&= \sum c_n \delta_{mn} \\
&= c_m
\end{align*}

So our coeffients are

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:PHY356FLecture10:51c}
c_m = \braket{a_m}{\phi}.
\end{equation}

The complete decomposition in terms of the chosen basis of $A$ is then

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:PHY356FLecture10:51b}
\ket{\phi} = \sum_n \braket{a_n}{\phi} \ket{a_n}
= \left( \sum_n \ket{a_n} \bra{a_n} \right) \ket{\phi}.
\end{equation}

Note carefully the physics convention for this complex inner product.  We have linearty in the \underline{second} argument

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:PHY356FLecture10:51e}
\braket{\psi}{a \phi} = a \braket{\psi}{\phi},
\end{equation}

whereas the normal mathematics convention is to define complex inner products as linear in the \underline{first} argument

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:PHY356FLecture10:51f}
\innerprod{a \psi}{\phi} = a \innerprod{\psi}{\phi}.
\end{equation}

We can make an analogy with 3D Euclidian inner products easily

\begin{align*}
\Bv = \sum_i v_i \Be_i
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
\Be_1 \cdot \Bv = \sum_i v_i \Be_1 \cdot \Be_i = v_1
\end{align*}

Physical information comes from the probability for obtaining a measurement of the physical entity associated with operator $A$.  The probability of obtaining outcome $a_m$, an eigenvalue of $A$, is $\Abs{c_m}^2$
