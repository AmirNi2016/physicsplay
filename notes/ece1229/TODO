- need .eps -> pdf rules.  Not finding:

   ../../figures/ece1229/arrayFactorXYCorrectedFig4

  building on lagrangian.

- cref to a lemma isn't working (reciprocityTheorem.tex)?  shows up as eq.

- epstopdf rules in ../blogit/ introducing make dependency in that dir, and failures in this
  one if not make'd there first.

- figure out how to change listing header from figure to listing (seen an answer for this on tex.stackexchange).

- figure out where to put a biographical blurb (for this and other collections).
  bio.txt has what I put on the google books biography tab for gabook.pdf (and others).
