- use subfigure for the handwriting decoder ring.

- epstopdf rules in ../blogit/ introducing make dependency in that dir, and failures in this
 one if not make'd there first.

- Add to blog mathjax table:

\ifrac
\eqntext
\Real -> \textrm{Re}

could allow:

\S -> section

- indexing for chapter 2 notes (from blog post tags):

antenna, Poynting vector, linear media, magnetization, far field, radiation intensity, impedance, free space, electric dipole, magnetic dipole, spherical wave, Mathematica, ParametricPlot, ParametricPlot3D, superposition, intensity, dB, decibel, dBi, spherical coordinates, parametric plot, gain, isotropic radiator, polarization vector, phasor, plane wave, power, average power, complex power, radar cross section, spherical scattering, optical limit, Mie scattering, Rayleigh scattering

- figure out how to change listing header from figure to listing (seen an answer for this on tex.stackexchange).

- indexing for chapter 3 notes

constituative relations, continuity equation, divergence theorem, Green's function, impulse response, linear time invariant, magnetic charge, magnetic source, Maxwell's equations, phasor, Stokes' theorem

- indexing for tai and periera notes

   directivity, ece1229, electric dipole, electric field, far field, half power beamwidth, Poynting vector

- phasorMaxwellsGA . index the tags:

   Maxwell's equations, Maxwell's equation, potential, four potential, four current, curl, divergence, Geometric Algebra, GA, electric field, magnetic field, linear media, phasor, dot product, wedge product, pseudoscalar, cross product, dual, bivector, potential, antisymmetric, grade, scalar, Helmholz equation, Lorentz gauge, vector potential, scalar potential, Pauli basis, Minkowski space, spacetime gradient, four gradient, Maxwell-Faraday equation, Ampere's law

- dualPhasorMaxwellsGA . index the tags: (above + magnetic charge,magnetic current)

- phasorMaxwellsWithElectricAndMagneticCharges.tex : tags:

Maxwell's equations, Maxwell's equation, Geometric Algebra, duality, electic source, magnetic source, phasor, geometric product, pseudoscalar, four vector, four gradient, curl, divergence, wedge product, Lorentz gauge, Helmholtz equation

electric field, magnetic field, electric sources, magnetic sources, spacetime split, spacetime gradient, four potential, vector potential, scalar potential

- style audit for figures (start with caps, end with period).

- figure out where to put a biographical blurb (for this and other collections).  This is what I put on the google books biography tab for gabook.pdf

Peeter Joot is a computer programmer for IBM Canada, and works on the Unix/Windows version of DB2.  His years of database programming have been in the lowest levels of guts of the DB2 product, doing system level programming like asynchronous IO implementation and exploitation, Linux and 64-bit porting, concurrency infrastructure (lockless reader/writer mutex implementation, ...), and some aspects of DB2's pureScale redundancy and failover support.

Peeter received a BASc in Engineering Science (computer) from UofT, and supplemented this with a number of undergrad physics courses for fun in recent times.  He is currently enrolled part time as an M.Eng student in the UofT department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, studying electromagnetism.
