- FIXME: nbref to handle.  Use mathImageFigure for the chapter4Notes images where appropriate.

- use subfigure for the handwriting decoder ring.

- epstopdf rules in ../blogit/ introducing make dependency in that dir, and failures in this
 one if not make'd there first.

- Add to blog mathjax table:

\ifrac
\eqntext
\Real -> \textrm{Re}

could allow:

\S -> section

- figure out how to change listing header from figure to listing (seen an answer for this on tex.stackexchange).

- style audit for figures (start with caps, end with period).

- figure out where to put a biographical blurb (for this and other collections).  This is what I put on the google books biography tab for gabook.pdf

- do indexing for problem sets.

- convert julia href reference to nbref.  probably have to add julia macros like the matlab and mathematica ones.

Peeter Joot is a computer programmer for IBM Canada, and works on the Unix/Windows version of DB2.  His years of database programming have been in the lowest levels of guts of the DB2 product, doing system level programming like asynchronous IO implementation and exploitation, Linux and 64-bit porting, concurrency infrastructure (lockless reader/writer mutex implementation, ...), and some aspects of DB2's pureScale redundancy and failover support.

Peeter received a BASc in Engineering Science (computer) from UofT, and supplemented this with a number of undergrad physics courses for fun in recent times.  He is currently enrolled part time as an M.Eng student in the UofT department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, studying electromagnetism.
