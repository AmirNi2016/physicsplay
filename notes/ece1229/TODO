- Add to blog mathjax table:

\ifrac
\chaptext
\eqntext
\Real -> \textrm{Re}

could allow:

\S -> section

- indexing for chapter 2 notes (from blog post tags):

antenna, Poynting vector, linear media, magnetization, far field, radiation intensity, impedance, free space, electric dipole, magnetic dipole, spherical wave, Mathematica, ParametricPlot, ParametricPlot3D, superposition, intensity, dB, decibel, dBi, spherical coordinates, parametric plot, gain, isotropic radiator, polarization vector, phasor, plane wave, power, average power, complex power, radar cross section, spherical scattering, optical limit, Mie scattering, Rayleigh scattering

- Tabulate all the handwriting recognition fragments into a single collection in the appendix.

- figure out how to change listing header from figure to listing (seen an answer for this on tex.stackexchange).

- indexing for chapter 3 notes

constituative relations, continuity equation, divergence theorem, Green's function, impulse response, linear time invariant, magnetic charge, magnetic source, Maxwell's equations, phasor, Stokes' theorem
