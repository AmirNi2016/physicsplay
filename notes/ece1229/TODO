- epstopdf rules in ../blogit/ introducing make dependency in that dir, and failures in this
 one if not make'd there first.

- Add to blog mathjax table:

\ifrac
\eqntext
\Real -> \textrm{Re}

could allow:

\S -> section

- indexing for chapter 2 notes (from blog post tags):

antenna, Poynting vector, linear media, magnetization, far field, radiation intensity, impedance, free space, electric dipole, magnetic dipole, spherical wave, Mathematica, ParametricPlot, ParametricPlot3D, superposition, intensity, dB, decibel, dBi, spherical coordinates, parametric plot, gain, isotropic radiator, polarization vector, phasor, plane wave, power, average power, complex power, radar cross section, spherical scattering, optical limit, Mie scattering, Rayleigh scattering

- figure out how to change listing header from figure to listing (seen an answer for this on tex.stackexchange).

- indexing for chapter 3 notes

constituative relations, continuity equation, divergence theorem, Green's function, impulse response, linear time invariant, magnetic charge, magnetic source, Maxwell's equations, phasor, Stokes' theorem

- indexing for tai and periera notes

   directivity, ece1229, electric dipole, electric field, far field, half power beamwidth, Poynting vector

- phasorMaxwellsGA . index the tags:

   Maxwell's equations, Maxwell's equation, potential, four potential, four current, curl, divergence, Geometric Algebra, GA, electric field, magnetic field, linear media, phasor, dot product, wedge product, pseudoscalar, cross product, dual, bivector, potential, antisymmetric, grade, scalar, Helmholz equation, Lorentz gauge, vector potential, scalar potential, Pauli basis, Minkowski space, spacetime gradient, four gradient, Maxwell-Faraday equation, Ampere's law

- dualPhasorMaxwellsGA . index the tags: (above + magnetic charge,magnetic current)

- style audit for figures (start with caps, end with period).
