tags for second post of energyMomentumWithMagneticSources.tex

Poynting theorem, reciprocity theorm, frequency domain

 (what were the tags for the first post?)

- reciprocity notes:

tags:
   reciprocity theorem, magnetic current density, electric current density, curl, phasor, divergence, far field, transverse field, 

- reciprocity GA notes:

tags:
   reciprocity theorem, geometric algebra, antisymmetric sum, combined electromagnetic field, grade selection

- cref to a lemma isn't working (reciprocityTheorem.tex)?  shows up as eq.

- FIXME: nbref to handle.  Use mathImageFigure for the chapter4Notes images where appropriate.

- use subfigure for the handwriting decoder ring.

- epstopdf rules in ../blogit/ introducing make dependency in that dir, and failures in this
 one if not make'd there first.

- Add to blog mathjax table:

\ifrac
\eqntext
\Real -> \textrm{Re}

could allow:

\S -> section

- figure out how to change listing header from figure to listing (seen an answer for this on tex.stackexchange).

- style audit for figures (start with caps, end with period).

- figure out where to put a biographical blurb (for this and other collections).  bio.txt has what I put on the google books biography tab for gabook.pdf (and others).
