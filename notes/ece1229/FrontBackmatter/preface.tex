This document is based on my lecture notes for the Spring 2015, University of Toronto Advanced Antenna Theory course (ECE1229H), taught by Professor G. V. Eleftheriades.  

\paragraph{Official course description:}

``This course deals with the analysis and design of a range of antennas. Topics addressed include: definitions of antenna parameters; vector potentials; solutions to the inhomogeneous wave equation; principles of duality and reciprocity; wire antennas; antenna arrays; phased arrays; synthesis techniques for discrete and continuous line sources; integral equations and solutions using the method of moments; field equivalence principle; aperture antennas; antenna measurement techniques; diffraction; horn antennas; reflector antennas; microstrip antennas; reflectarrays; electrically small antennas; and broadband antennas.''

\paragraph{This document contains:}

\begin{itemize}
\item Plain old lecture notes.   These mirror what was covered in class, possibly augmented with additional details.  

\item Personal notes exploring details that were not clear to me from the lectures, or from the texts associated with the lecture material.

\ifthenelse{\boolean{redacted}}%
{%
\item Assigned problems.  Like anything else take these as is.  I have attempted to either correct errors or mark them as such.%

{\relax}

%\item Some worked problems attempted as course prep, for fun, or for test preparation, or post test reflection.

%\item Links to Matlab function implementations associated with the problem sets.
\end{itemize}

My thanks go to Professor Eleftheriades for teaching this course.
