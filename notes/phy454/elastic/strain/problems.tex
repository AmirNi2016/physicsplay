\label{problem:strain:ps1q2a}
\subsection{Strain tensor for a small displacement.}

Small displacement field in a material is given by

\begin{align}\label{eqn:continuumProblemSet1:30}
e_1 &= 2 x_1 x_2 \\
e_2 &= x_3^2 \\
e_3 &= x_1^2 - x_3
\end{align}

Find

\begin{enumerate}
\item The infinitesimal strain tensor $e_{ij}$,
\item The principal strains and the corresponding principal axes at $(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (1, 2, 4)$.
\end{enumerate}

Solution can be found in \ref{solutions:ps1q2a}.
