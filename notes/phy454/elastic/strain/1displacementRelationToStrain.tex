\section{Unresolved: Relating displacement and position by strain}

In \cite{feynman1963flp:elasticMaterials} it is pointed out that this strain tensor simply relates the displacement vector coordinates $u_i$ to the coordinates at the point at which it is measured

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:continuumElasticityReview:110}
u_i = e_{ij} x_j.
\end{equation}

When we get to fluid dynamics we perform a linear expansion of $du_i$ and find something similar

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:continuumElasticityReview:530}
dx_i' - dx_i = du_i = \PD{x_k}{u_i} dx_k = e_{ij} dx_k + \omega_{ij} dx_k
\end{equation}

where

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:continuumElasticityReview:550}
\omega_{ij} = \inv{2} \left( \PD{x_i}{u_j} +\PD{x_j}{u_i} \right).
\end{equation}

Except for the antisymmetric term, note the structural similarity of \ref{eqn:continuumElasticityReview:110} and \ref{eqn:continuumElasticityReview:530}.  Why is it that we neglect the vorticity tensor in statics?
%  If we are approximating the displacement, it appears to have a natural place in things, as we can see
%
%\begin{align*}
%u_i 
%&\approx \PD{x_j}{u_i} x_j \\
%&=
%e_{ij} x_j + \omega_{ik} x_k.
%\end{align*}
%
%This is easily seen to be the case, recovering \ref{eqn:continuumElasticityReview:90} by taking derivatives of \ref{eqn:continuumElasticityReview:110}, plus an assumption that $e_{ij}$ is symmetric.
