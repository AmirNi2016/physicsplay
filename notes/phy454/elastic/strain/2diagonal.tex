\section{Diagonal strain representation.}

In a basis for which the strain tensor is diagonal, it was pointed out that we can write our difference in squared displacement as (for $k = 1, 2, 3$, no summation convention)

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:continuumElasticityReview:130}
(dx_k')^2 - (dx_k)^2 = 2 e_{kk} dx_k dx_k
\end{equation}

from which we can rearrange, take roots, and apply a first order Taylor expansion to find (again no summation convention)

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:continuumElasticityReview:150}
dx_k' \approx (1 + e_{kk}) dx_k.
\end{equation}

An approximation of the displaced volume was then found in terms of the strain tensor trace (summation convention back again)

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:continuumElasticityReview:170}
dV' \approx (1 + e_{kk}) dV,
\end{equation}

allowing us to identify this trace as a relative difference in displaced volume

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:continuumElasticityReview:190}
e_{kk} \approx \frac{dV' - dV}{dV}.
\end{equation}
