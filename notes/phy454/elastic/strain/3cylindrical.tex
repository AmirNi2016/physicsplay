\section{Strain in cylindrical coordinates}

Useful in many practice problems are the cylindrical coordinate representation of the strain tensor 

\begin{align}\label{eqn:continuumElasticityReview:210}
2 e_{rr} &= \PD{r}{u_r}  \\
2 e_{\phi\phi} &= \inv{r} \PD{\phi}{u_\phi} +\inv{r} u_r  \\
2 e_{zz} &= \PD{z}{u_z}  \\
2 e_{zr} &= \PD{z}{u_r} + \PD{r}{u_z} \\
2 e_{r\phi} &= \PD{r}{u_\phi} - \inv{r} u_\phi + \inv{r} \PD{\phi}{u_r} \\
2 e_{\phi z} &= \PD{z}{u_\phi} +\inv{r} \PD{\phi}{u_z}.
\end{align}

This result can be found in \citep{landau1960theory}, and is derived in appendix \ref{chap:appendix:strainCoordinates} using the second order methods found above for the Cartesian tensor.

An easier way to do this derivation (and understand what the coordinates represent) follows from the relation found in \S 6 of \citep{acheson1990elementary}

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:continuumElasticityReview:230}
2 \Be_i e_{ij} \Be_j \cdot \ncap = 2 (\ncap \cdot \spacegrad) \Bu + \ncap \cross (\spacegrad \cross \Bu),
\end{equation}

where $\ncap$ is the normal to the surface at which we are measuring a force applied to the solid (our Cauchy tetrahedron).

The cylindrical tensor coordinates of \ref{eqn:continuumElasticityReview:210} follow from 
\ref{eqn:continuumElasticityReview:230} nicely taking $\ncap = \rcap, \phicap, \zcap$ in turn.  This derivation can be found in appendix \ref{chap:continuumstressTensorVectorForm}.
