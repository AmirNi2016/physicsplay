\section{Example: radial stretch}

Suppose we have a fire fighter's safety net, used to catch somebody jumping from a burning building (do they ever do that outside of movies?), as in figure (\ref{fig:continuumL3:continuumL3fig6}).  Each of the firefighters contributes to the stretch.  

\imageCentered{figures/continuumL3fig6}{Radial forces.}{fig:continuumL3:continuumL3fig6}{0.2}

FIXME: what form would the tensor take for this?  Would we have to use a radial form of the tensor?  What would that be?
