\section{Stress tensor.}

Reading for this section is \S 2 from \cite{landau1960theory}.

We'd like to consider a macroscopic model that contains the net effects of all the internal forces in the object as depicted in figure (\ref{fig:continuumL3:continuumL3fig2})

\imageFigure{figures/continuumL3fig2}{Internal forces.}{fig:continuumL3:continuumL3fig2}{0.2}

We will consider a volume big enough that we won't have to consider the individual atomic interactions, only the average effects of those interactions.  Will will look at the force per unit volume on a differential volume element

The total force on the body is 

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:continuumL3:230}
\iiint \BF dV,
\end{equation}

where $\BF$ is the force per unit volume.  We will evaluate this by utilizing the divergence theorem.  Recall that this was

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:continuumL3:250}
\iiint (\spacegrad \cdot \BA) dV
= \iint \BA \cdot d\Bs
\end{equation}

We have a small problem, since we have a non-divergence expression of the force here, and it is not immediately obvious that we can apply the divergence theorem.  We can deal with this by assuming that we can find a vector valued tensor, so that if we take the divergence of this tensor, we end up with the force.  We introduce the vector valued quantity

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:continuumL3:270}
\BF = \Be_i \PD{x_k}{\sigma_{ik}},
\end{equation}

and then apply the divergence theorem

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:continuumL3:290}
\iiint \BF dV 
= \iiint \Be_i \PD{x_k}{\sigma_{ik}} d\Bx^3 
=
\iint \Be_i \sigma_{ik} ds_k,
\end{equation}

where $ds_k$ is a surface element.  We identify this tensor

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:continuumL3:310}
\sigma_{ik} = \frac{\text{Force} \cdot \Be_i}{\text{Unit Area}},
\end{equation}

often writing it in matrix form

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:continuumL3:350}
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_{11} & \sigma_{12} & \sigma_{13} \\
\sigma_{21} & \sigma_{22} & \sigma_{23} \\
\sigma_{31} & \sigma_{32} & \sigma_{33}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

Our total force acting on the surface is given by the matrix product of the stress with the triplet of surface area elements

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:continuumL3:330}
f_i = \sigma_{ik} ds_k,
\end{equation}

as the force on the surface element $ds_k$.  

\subsection{Example: stretch in two opposing directions.}

\imageFigure{figures/continuumL3fig4}{Opposing stresses in one direction.}{fig:continuumL3:continuumL3fig4}{0.2}

Here, as illustrated in figure (\ref{fig:continuumL3:continuumL3fig4}), the associated (2D) stress tensor takes the simple form

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:continuumL3:370}
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_{11} & 0 \\
0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

This is called uniaxial stress \index{uniaxial stress}.

\subsection{Example: stretch in a pair of mutually perpendicular directions}

For a pair of perpendicular forces applied in two dimensions, as illustrated in figure (\ref{fig:continuumL3:continuumL3fig5})
\imageFigure{figures/continuumL3fig5}{Mutually perpendicular forces}{fig:continuumL3:continuumL3fig5}{0.2}

our stress tensor now just takes the form

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:continuumL3:390}
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_{11} & 0 \\
0 & \sigma_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

This is called biaxial stress \index{biaxial stress}.

It's easy to imagine now how to get some more general stress tensors, should we make a change of basis that rotates our frame.

\subsection{Example: radial stretch}

Suppose we have a fire fighter's safety net, used to catch somebody jumping from a burning building (do they ever do that outside of movies?), as in figure (\ref{fig:continuumL3:continuumL3fig6}).  Each of the firefighters contributes to the stretch.
