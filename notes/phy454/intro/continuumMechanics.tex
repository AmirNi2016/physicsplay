\section{Continuum Mechanics.}

Mechanics could be defined as the study of effects of forces and displacements on a physical body

In continuum mechanics we have a physical body and we are interested in the internal motions in the object.

For the first time considering mechanics we have to introduce the concepts of fields to make progress tackling these problems.

We will have use of the following types of fields

\begin{itemize}
\item Scalar fields.  $3^0$ components.  Examples: density, Temperature, ...
\item Vector fields.  $3^1$ components.  Examples: Force, velocity.
\item Tensor fields.  $3^2$ components.  Examples: stress, strain.
\end{itemize}

We have to consider objects (a control volume) that is small enough that we can consider that we have a point in space limit for the quantities of density and velocity.  At the same time we cannot take this limiting process to the extreme, since if we use a control volume that is sufficiently small, quantum and inter-atomic effects would have to be considered.

\subsection{Stress and Strain definitions.}

\begin{definition}
\emph{(Strain)}
\label{dfn:continuumL2:30}
Measure of the deformation of the body.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
\emph{(Stress)}
\label{dfn:continuumL2:10}
Measure of the Internal force on the surfaces.
\end{definition}
