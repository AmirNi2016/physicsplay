- rework problem sets, midterm reflection, and portions of the review notes using the exercise class.  probably emit the solutions at the end of the elasticity and fluids sections respectively.  have grouped some of this now in the fluids section.  change to exercise style, then later move to more appropriate sections if creating them.

- add stubs for problems in the elasticity section.  note that 3d compatibility was supposed to have had homework.

- attempt the extra optional homework from handouts/ClassNote17.pdf

- attempt the problem to derive the compatibility condition.  Doing this should help resolve the issue of how the stress tensor can be applied.

- grep for all FIXMEs and TODOs (latex files, and makefiles) and prioritize.

- have left the two exploratory worked problems at the end in a 'worked problem' section. ... delete these? (OR COMPLETE).

- stress chapter could use a lot of rework, but some of the redundancy is gone.  Cleaning up and removing some of the figures would help.

- indexing: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Indexing
   -- got the make rules done (standalone sample: ../latex/index.tex).
   -- now have to add all the index tags.  Start with the wordpress keywords.  May have to mine the exported xml file for my tags.

- graphical cover page (stirred cup of coffee;) would be nice.

- review all the text and remove anything derogatory seeming about the Prof's failure to assign homework, or lack of real problems for some 
  topics.

- spell check everything.

- add back copyright statements in all .tex files.

- would be nice to have the bib and index show up as parts directly without having to have chapter headings in the parts (like the preface and contents).
  One solution would be to flatten the chapters.  Especially now that I've got most of my worked problems moved into Q/A environments (to be moved along with the relavent material).

- add some structure to the fluids chapters.  There will be a lot of redundancy to remove there too.

- add some colour to the Exercise and answer headers.

- have picked too long titles for some of my Exercises.  Capitalize all these titles.  Curve for tap: requires description.

- had commented out some of my section/subsection headers in my worked problems.  Convert those to paragraph headings.  Can add paragraph headings to give titles to sub-Question answers.

- not entirely pleased with how the exercise environment ends up looking.  Could end up rewriting that using the latex templates sample.

- In inclinedFlowWithoutConstantHeightAssumption: figure: Differential vector element ... MIA?

- add structure to the fluids chapters and review for redundancy.  Possible chapters:
   Fluid Dynamics
      - derive NS
      - no slip
      - boundary value conditions
   Steady State Navier Stokes
   Non-dimensionalisation
   Time dependent Navier Stokes
      - Boundary layers
   Ill conditioned differential equations
   Stability and thermal effects

- how to format a chapter without a whole page used for the title of the chapter.
		This was due to use of \chapter followed by \include.  Switched to input instead.  won't matter when \chapter is embedded in the chapter text.
- switch to the memoir class has made the text more paper-book-like, with margins switching sides (and smaller I think) on even and odd pages.  Figure out how to undo that so that the book is more uniform for online reading.

-- Would be nice to format the part's like the chapter style though.  Saw one example on tex stackexchange how to do so, but not for my chapter style.

- second chapter heading spacing (strain) is all messed up.   but no others?
  - try standalone repro to isolate.

- took out the \part's but probably want them back to at least separate the lecture notes from the worked problems.  

- okay, put back two parts, but things are still a bit messed up.  have the appendix and bib stuck in the second part for example.  Add unnamed part?  ... had to put the appendices and bib in their own parts.  Good enough.

- don't like the centering of the Exercise environment.  See about adjusting that to remove the centering.

- (non-ugly) title page would be nice.

- looks like I got my Exercise headings left justified like I wanted, but there's no space between the number and the title text.
