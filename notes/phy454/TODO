- rework problem sets, midterm reflection, and portions of the review notes using the exercise class.  probably emit the solutions at the end of the elasticity and fluids sections respectively.

- add stubs for problems in the elasticity section.  note that 3d compatibility was supposed to have had homework.

- grab the extra optional homework from the website before it is gone.  attempt this.

- attempt the problem to derive the compatibility condition.  Doing this should help resolve the issue of how the stress tensor can be applied.

- grep for all FIXMEs and TODOs (latex files, and makefiles) and prioritize.

- leave exploratory worked problems, esp. multi-section ones at the end in a 'worked problem' section.

- finish the consolidation and restructuring of the elasticity section and get that in good shape before moving on to fluids.

- don't like the centering of the Exersize environment.  See about adjusting that to remove the centering.

- indexing: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Indexing

- switch to the memoir class has made the text more paper-book-like, with margins switching sides (and smaller I think) on even and odd pages.  Figure out how to undo that so that the book is more uniform for online reading.

- took out the \part's but probably want them back to at least separate the lecture notes from the worked problems.  Would be nice to format the part's like the chapter style though.  Saw one example on tex stackexchange how to do so, but not for my chapter style.

=====
- how to format a chapter without a whole page used for the title of the chapter.
		This was due to use of \chapter followed by \include.  Switched to input instead.  won't matter when \chapter is embedded in the chapter text.
