- rework problem sets, midterm reflection, and portions of the review notes using the exercise class.  probably emit the solutions at the end of the elasticity and fluids sections respectively.
- add stubs for problems in the elasticity section.  note that 3d compatibility was supposed to have had homework.
- grab the extra optional homework from the website before it is gone.  attempt this.
- attempt the problem to derive the compatibility condition.  Doing this should help resolve the issue of how the stress tensor can be applied.
- grep for all FIXMEs and TODOs (latex files, and makefiles) and prioritize.
- leave exploratory worked problems, esp. multi-section ones at the end in a 'worked problem' section.
- finish the consolidation and restructuring of the elasticity section and get that in good shape before moving on to fluids.
