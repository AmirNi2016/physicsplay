\chapter{FIXME: Midterm discussion.}

Put any of this with the solutions if worth keeping.

\section{Midterm discussion.}

We had been asked to solve a 1D flow problem with one fixed surface, and one moving surface, as illustrated in figure (\ref{fig:continuumL13:continuumL13Fig1})
\imageFigure{figures/continuumL13Fig1}{Return flow configuration.  One fixed surface, one moving surface.}{fig:continuumL13:continuumL13Fig1}{0.2}

we end up showing that our solutions are of the forms

\begin{itemize}
\item 
Shear flow (\ref{fig:continuumL13:continuumL13Fig2a}).  $U \ne 0, G = 0$.
\imageFigure{figures/continuumL13Fig2a}{Shear Flow.}{fig:continuumL13:continuumL13Fig2a}{0.2}
\item Channel flow (\ref{fig:continuumL13:continuumL13Fig2b}).  $U = 0, G \ne 0$.
\imageFigure{figures/continuumL13Fig2b}{Channel flow}{fig:continuumL13:continuumL13Fig2b}{0.2}
\item Return flow (\ref{fig:continuumL13:continuumL13Fig2c}).  $U \ne 0, G \ne 0$.
\imageFigure{figures/continuumL13Fig2c}{Return flow.}{fig:continuumL13:continuumL13Fig2c}{0.2}
\end{itemize}

Note that the last sort of solution, that of return flow, was discussed in the context of surface tension.
