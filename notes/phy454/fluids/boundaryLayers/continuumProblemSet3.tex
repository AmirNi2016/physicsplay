\makeproblem{Velocity phase difference in oscillatory Stokes boundary layer problem}{problem:fluids:ps3:q3}{
Starting with the solution of the Stokes' boundary layer problem calculate shear stress on the plate $y = 0$.   What is the phase difference between the velocity of the plate $U(t) = U_0 \cos\omega t$ and the shear stress on the plate?

\makeanswer{problem:fluids:ps3:q3}{
We found in class that the velocity of the fluid was given by

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:continuumProblemSet3:370}
u(y, t) = U_0 e^{-\lambda y} \cos(\lambda y - \omega t)
\end{equation}

where

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:continuumProblemSet3:390}
\lambda = \sqrt{\frac{\omega}{2 \nu}}
\end{equation}

Calculating our shear stress we find

\begin{align*}
\mu \PD{y}{u} 
&= U_0 \lambda \mu e^{-\lambda y}
\left(
-1
-
 \sin(\lambda y - \omega t)
\right)
\end{align*}

and on the plate ($y = 0$) this is just

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:continuumProblemSet3:410}
\evalbar{\mu \PD{y}{u}}{y = 0} = U_0 \lambda \mu (-1 + \sin(\omega t)).
\end{equation}

We've got a constant term, plus one that is sinusoidal.  Observing that 

\begin{align}\label{eqn:continuumProblemSet3:430}
\cos x &= \Real( e^{ix} )  \\
\sin x &= \Real( -i e^{ix} ) = \Real( e^{i (x - \pi/2)} ),
\end{align}

The phase difference between the non-constant portion of the shear stress at the plate, and the plate velocity $U(t) = U_0 \cos\omega t$ is just $-\pi/2$.  The shear stress at the plate lags the driving velocity by 90 degrees.

%\FIXME{review posted solutions.  I think Prof Das posted a $5 \pi/4$ result?}
