This document contains the class notes taken by Peeter Joot for the University of Toronto Continuum Mechanics course (PHY454H1S), taught by Prof.\ Kausik S. Das in Winter 2012.  It also contains a number of worked problems, both problem set solutions and exam preparation.

Official course description:

The theory of continuous matter, including solid and fluid mechanics.  Topics include the continuum approximation, dimensional analysis, stress, strain, the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations, vorticity, waves, instabilities, convection and turbulence.

What you will find in this document:

\begin{itemize}
\item Lecture notes, reworked after completion of the course into what is hopefully a more coherent and compact form.

\item Problem sets and midterm solutions. These have been incorporated into the lecture material as chapter end problems with solutions.

\item Some worked problems attempted for fun or for exam preparation.

\item Links to Mathematica workbooks associated with course content.

\end{itemize}
