These are my personal lecture notes for the Winter 2012, University of Toronto Continuum Mechanics course (PHY454H1S), taught by Prof.\ Kausik S. Das.

The official description for this course was:

The theory of continuous matter, including solid and fluid mechanics.  Topics include the continuum approximation, dimensional analysis, stress, strain, the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations, vorticity, waves, instabilities, convection and turbulence.

\begin{itemize}
\item My lecture notes.

Typos, if any, are probably mine (Peeter), and no claim nor attempt of spelling or grammar correctness will be made.

\item Some personal notes exploring details that weren't clear to me from the lectures, or from the texts associated with the lecture material.

\item Some worked problems.

\item Links to mathematica workbooks associated with course content.
