% IEEEtran V1.7 and later provides for these CLASSINPUT macros to allow the
% user to reprogram some IEEEtran.cls defaults if needed. These settings
% override the internal defaults of IEEEtran.cls regardless of which class
% options are used. Do not use these unless you have good reason to do so as
% they can result in nonIEEE compliant documents. User beware. ;)

% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in

% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.

% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  % \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  % \usepackage{cite}
\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later.
%
% Note also the use of a CLASSOPTION conditional provided by 
% IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later.





% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage{acronym}
% acronym.sty was written by Tobias Oetiker. This package provides tools for
% managing documents with large numbers of acronyms. (You don't *have* to
% use this package - unless you have a lot of acronyms, you may feel that
% such package management of them is bit of an overkill.)
% Do note that the acronym environment (which lists acronyms) will have a
% problem when used under IEEEtran.cls because acronym.sty relies on the
% description list environment - which IEEEtran.cls has customized for
% producing IEEE style lists. A workaround is to declared the longest
% label width via the IEEEtran.cls \IEEEiedlistdecl global control:
%
% \renewcommand{\IEEEiedlistdecl}{\IEEEsetlabelwidth{SONET}}
% \begin{acronym}
%
% \end{acronym}
% \renewcommand{\IEEEiedlistdecl}{\relax}% remember to reset \IEEEiedlistdecl
%
% instead of using the acronym environment's optional argument.
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/acronym/


%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/url/
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.


% NOTE: PDF thumbnail features are not required in IEEE papers
%       and their use requires extra complexity and work.
%\ifCLASSINFOpdf
%  \usepackage[pdftex]{thumbpdf}
%\else
%  \usepackage[dvips]{thumbpdf}
%\fi
% thumbpdf.sty and its companion Perl utility were written by Heiko Oberdiek.
% It allows the user a way to produce PDF documents that contain fancy
% thumbnail images of each of the pages (which tools like acrobat reader can
% utilize). This is possible even when using dvi->ps->pdf workflow if the
% correct thumbpdf driver options are used. thumbpdf.sty incorporates the
% file containing the PDF thumbnail information (filename.tpm is used with
% dvips, filename.tpt is used with pdftex, where filename is the base name of
% your tex document) into the final ps or pdf output document. An external
% utility, the thumbpdf *Perl script* is needed to make these .tpm or .tpt
% thumbnail files from a .ps or .pdf version of the document (which obviously
% does not yet contain pdf thumbnails). Thus, one does a:
% 
% thumbpdf filename.pdf 
%
% to make a filename.tpt, and:
%
% thumbpdf --mode dvips filename.ps
%
% to make a filename.tpm which will then be loaded into the document by
% thumbpdf.sty the NEXT time the document is compiled (by pdflatex or
% latex->dvips->ps2pdf). Users must be careful to regenerate the .tpt and/or
% .tpm files if the main document changes and then to recompile the
% document to incorporate the revised thumbnails to ensure that thumbnails
% match the actual pages. It is easy to forget to do this!
% 
% Unix systems come with a Perl interpreter. However, MS Windows users
% will usually have to install a Perl interpreter so that the thumbpdf
% script can be run. The Ghostscript PS/PDF interpreter is also required.
% See the thumbpdf docs for details. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at.
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/thumbpdf/


% NOTE: PDF hyperlink and bookmark features are not required in IEEE
%       papers and their use requires extra complexity and work.
% *** IF USING HYPERREF BE SURE AND CHANGE THE EXAMPLE PDF ***

%\ifCLASSINFOpdf
%\usepackage[\MYhyperrefoptions,pdftex]{hyperref}
%\else
%\usepackage[\MYhyperrefoptions,breaklinks=true,dvips]{hyperref}
%\usepackage{breakurl}
%\fi
% One significant drawback of using hyperref under DVI output is that the
% LaTeX compiler cannot break URLs across lines or pages as can be done
% under pdfLaTeX's PDF output via the hyperref pdftex driver. This is
% probably the single most important capability distinction between the
% DVI and PDF output. Perhaps surprisingly, all the other PDF features
% (PDF bookmarks, thumbnails, etc.) can be preserved in
% .tex->.dvi->.ps->.pdf workflow if the respective packages/scripts are
% loaded/invoked with the correct driver options (dvips, etc.). 
% As most IEEE papers use URLs sparingly (mainly in the references), this
% may not be as big an issue as with other publications.
%
% That said, Vilar Camara Neto created his breakurl.sty package which
% permits hyperref to easily break URLs even in dvi mode.
% Note that breakurl, unlike most other packages, must be loaded
% AFTER hyperref. The latest version of breakurl and its documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/breakurl/
% breakurl.sty is not for use under pdflatex pdf mode.
%
% The advanced features offer by hyperref.sty are not required for IEEE
% submission, so users should weigh these features against the added
% complexity of use.
% The package options above demonstrate how to enable PDF bookmarks
% (a type of table of contents viewable in Acrobat Reader) as well as
% PDF document information (title, subject, author and keywords) that is
% viewable in Acrobat reader's Document_Properties menu. PDF document
% information is also used extensively to automate the cataloging of PDF
% documents. The above set of options ensures that hyperlinks will not be
% colored in the text and thus will not be visible in the printed page,
% but will be active on "mouse over". USING COLORS OR OTHER HIGHLIGHTING
% OF HYPERLINKS CAN RESULT IN DOCUMENT REJECTION BY THE IEEE, especially if
% these appear on the "printed" page. IF IN DOUBT, ASK THE RELEVANT
% SUBMISSION EDITOR. You may need to add the option hypertexnames=false if
% you used duplicate equation numbers, etc., but this should not be needed
% in normal IEEE work.
% The latest version of hyperref and its documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/hyperref/





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
With this work the circuit solution system developed in ECE1254 for linear constant source RLC circuits is extended to compute steady state responses to periodic sources, and to include support for a simple non-linear diode model.
It is assumed that all input frequencies are multiples of a single fundamental frequency.
Anharmonic effects will be ignored, and it will be assumed that only periodic outputs with harmonics that are multiples of the input frequencies will be observed.
The solution utilizes the \emph{Harmonic Balance} method described in \citep{giannini2004NonlinearMicrowaveCircuitDesign}, where
time variation of the inputs and outputs is expressed as discrete time Fourier series expressed in a matrix form that can be handled readily by software.

Harmonic Balance method is an approach to determine the steady state response of nonlinear
circuits.
As only the steady state response of the circuit is of interest, the state of the circuit
only needs to be determined over one period.
Furthermore, it is assumed that for a sinusoidal input of a
fundamental frequency, the output signal will consist of a summation of sinusoids of integer multiples of
the input signal frequency (harmonics).
The final assumption is that a finite number of these harmonics,
\( N \), will be sufficient to accurately represent the output signal.
From the DFT, to obtain \( N \) discrete frequencies, \( N \) linearly spaced (in time) samples of a
signal are required.
Or conversely, for \( N \) discrete frequencies, a signal with \( N \) time samples is required.
The Harmonic Balance exploits the linear, time-invariant nature of circuits.
In the time domain, the Modified Nodal Analysis (MNA) procdure results in a set of \( R \) equations.
Translated into the 
frequency domain, the result is \( R \times (2 N + 1) \) independent sets of equations.
One way to
think of this, is that each frequency can be considered its own independent circuit.

The objective is to represent the linear circuit elements of the system in the form 

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:ece1254projectReport:560}
\BI = \BY \BV,
\end{equation}

with an ordering of the vector components given by

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:ece1254projectReport:580}
\BI = 
\begin{bmatrix}
I^{(1)}_{-N} \\
I^{(2)}_{-N} \\
%I^{(3)}_{-N} \\
\vdots \\
I^{(1)}_{1-N} \\
I^{(2)}_{1-N} \\
%I^{(3)}_{1-N} \\
\vdots \\
I^{(1)}_{N-1} \\
I^{(2)}_{N-1} \\
%I^{(3)}_{N-1} \\
\vdots \\
I^{(1)}_{N} \\
I^{(2)}_{N} \\
%I^{(3)}_{N} \\
\vdots \\
\end{bmatrix},
\qquad \BV = 
\begin{bmatrix}
V^{(1)}_{-N} \\
V^{(2)}_{-N} \\
%V^{(3)}_{-N} \\
\vdots \\
V^{(1)}_{1-N} \\
V^{(2)}_{1-N} \\
%V^{(3)}_{1-N} \\
\vdots \\
V^{(1)}_{N-1} \\
V^{(2)}_{N-1} \\
%V^{(3)}_{N-1} \\
\vdots \\
V^{(1)}_{N} \\
V^{(2)}_{N} \\
%V^{(3)}_{N} \\
\vdots \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

The superscript index of each element corresponds to the physical circuit node it is related to (i.e.
current flowing to the node, or the node voltage).  
Those unknown physical circuit elements are generated using a modified nodal analysis procedure.
The subscript corresponds to the harmonic frequency, so the end result is as if there is a 
node voltage for each harmonic frequency.

Ordering the vectors this way allows a block diagonal admittance matrix to be generated (\citep{giannini2004NonlinearMicrowaveCircuitDesign}
 \S 1.85)
, consisting of the admittance matrix that would be seen for each frequency.
%Peeter: I believe your code would give us the G and C matrices that arise from LMS formulations. This is
%great as we can generate each block Y(n?0) = G - jn?0C.

FIXME: move the following to background.  Group under alternative implementations.

This ordering of the vectors requires a modification of the standard DFT matrix (A.11 or A.17).
The standard DFT matrix is square with dimensions \( (2 N + 1 ) \times (2 N + 1 ) \).

However, with the elements of \( \BV \) are grouped by frequency,
this must be altered so that every value in each frequency group is multiplied by the same value in the DFT matrix.
For \( R \) values in each group (corresponds to \( R \) unknowns of a circuit) the values in the original 
matrix will be spaced by \( R \), padded with zeros.
And these modified rows will be repeated and shifted
right 1, \( M \) times.
The resulting DFT matrix has dimension \( ( R (2 N + 1 ) \times R (2 N + 1) ) \)
%(or use 2Nh +1)
For the case of nonlinear components, there will be a current, \( \mathcal{I}(\Bv) \), produced at each time sample to be determined.
By taking the DFT of these currents, the discrete frequency
components of the nonlinear currents are obtained.
Each nth-frequency component of this current would be added
to the equation of the nth-set of MNA equations corresponding to the nodes the element is connected
to.

\section{Background}
\subsection{Discrete Fourier Transform}
%\citep{giannini2004NonlinearMicrowaveCircuitDesign}

Following \citep{giannini2004NonlinearMicrowaveCircuitDesign} \S A.4, the circuit sources and outputs are assumed to be periodic (\( \omega_0 T = 2 \pi \)), and bandwidth limited, described by the following discrete Fourier transform pair

%\begin{equation}\label{eqn:ece1254projectReport:60}
\boxedEquation{eqn:ece1254projectReport:60}{
\begin{aligned}
x(t_k) &= \sum_{n = -N}^N X_n e^{ j n \omega_0 t_k} \\
X_n &= \inv{2 N + 1} \sum_{k = -N}^N x(t_k) e^{-j n \omega_0 t_k},
\end{aligned}
}
%\end{equation}

The times at which the signal is evaluated are evaluated only at the Nykvist times 
\index{Nykvist time instant}
\( t_k \), 

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:ece1254projectReport:20}
t_k = \frac{T k}{2 N + 1}, \qquad k \in [-N, \cdots N]
\end{equation}

all contained within the interior of the \( [-T/2, T/2] \) range of interest.  
A proof of this inversion relationship is given in \cref{appendix:discreteFourierInversion}.

A matrix representation of the transform pair is desired.  
Let \( x_k = x(t_k) \), and 
substitute \( t_k \) from \cref{eqn:ece1254projectReport:20}

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:ece1254projectReport:140}
\begin{aligned}
x_k &= \sum_{n = -N}^N X_n e^{ 2 \pi j n k /(2 N + 1)} \\
X_n &= \inv{2 N + 1} \sum_{k = -N}^N x_k e^{- 2 \pi j n k /(2 N + 1)}.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

With \( 
\Bx = 
{\begin{bmatrix}
x_{-N} &
\cdots &
x_0 &
\cdots &
x_{N}
\end{bmatrix}}^\T,
\BX = 
{\begin{bmatrix}
X_{-N} &
\cdots &
X_0 &
\cdots &
X_{N}
\end{bmatrix}}^\T 
\),  \( \alpha = e^{ 2 \pi j /(2 N + 1) } \), and \( \BF \) defined as

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:discreteFourierMatrixForm:360}
\small
\begin{bmatrix}
 \alpha^{N N } &  \alpha^{\lr{N-1} N }  & . &  \alpha^{- \lr{N-1} N }  &  \alpha^{- N N } \\
 \alpha^{N \lr{N-1} } &  \alpha^{\lr{N-1} \lr{N-1} }  & . &  \alpha^{- \lr{N-1} \lr{N-1} }  &  \alpha^{- N \lr{N-1} } \\
 .              &  .                      & .      & .                           &  .               \\
 \alpha^{- N \lr{N-1} } &  \alpha^{- \lr{N-1} \lr{N-1} }  & . &  \alpha^{{N-1} \lr{N-1} }  &  \alpha^{N \lr{N-1} } \\
 \alpha^{- N N } &  \alpha^{- N N }  & . &  \alpha^{\lr{N-1} N }  &  \alpha^{N N } \\
\end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}

the transform pair has the matrix form

\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:discreteFourierMatrixForm:380}
\Bx = \BF \BX
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:discreteFourierMatrixForm:400}
\BX = \inv{2 N + 1} \overbar{\BF} \Bx,
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}

where \( \overbar{\BF} \) is the complex conjugate of \( \BF \).

\subsection{Harmonic Balance equations}

The time domain MNA equations for an RLC network with non-linear sources can be put into the form

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:ece1254projectReport:420}
\BG \Bx(t) + \BC \dot{\Bx}(t) = \BB \Bu(t) + \BD \Bw(t).
\end{equation}

With \( R \) equal to the number of unknowns, \( S \) equal to the number of non-linear elements, \( M \) equal to the number of (positive, negative and zero) frequency sources, the dimensions of these matrices are

\begin{itemize}
\item 
\( \BG, \BC \in \text{\R{R \times R}} \)
\item 
\( \BB \in \text{\C{R \times M}} \)
\item 
\( \BD \in \text{\R{R \times S}} \)
\item 
\( \Bx(t) \in \text{\R{R \times 1}} \)
\item 
\( \Bu(t) \in \text{\R{M \times 1}} \)
\item 
\( \Bw(t) \in \text{\R{S \times 1}} \)
\end{itemize}

The matrix \( \Bu(t) \) contains has a non-zero value for each source frequency source in the system.  For example, if there is a DC source (or a diode for which the model includes a DC source), and one source at twice the fundamental frequency, this would be

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:ece1254projectReport:440}
\Bu(t) = 
\begin{bmatrix}
e^{ -j \omega_0 2 t } \\
1 \\
e^{ j \omega_0 2 t }
\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}

In an implementation of code that generates MNA equations it is useful to store just the frequencies associated with these sources, and not any sort of actual time dependence representation.  For the example of \cref{eqn:ece1254projectReport:440} a matrix of this form would be stored

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:ece1254projectReport:460}
\Bu =
\begin{bmatrix}
- 2 \omega_0 \\
0 \\
2 \omega_0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}

The matrix \( \Bw(t) \) contains one row for each unique non-linear source, not including the magnitude of that source.  For example, if the only non-linear source in the system is a diode modelled by \( i_d(t) = I_0 \lr{ e^{ v/v_T} - 1 } \), then \( \BD \) would be a \( R \times 1 \) matrix and \( \Bw(t) \) would be a \( 1 \times 1 \) matrix

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:ece1254projectReport:480}
\Bw =
\begin{bmatrix}
e^{ v/v_T }
\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Frequency domain representation of MNA equations}

Assuming a bandlimited periodic representation of the unknowns vector \( \Bx \) in \cref{eqn:ece1254projectReport:420}

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:ece1254projectReport:500}
x^{(i)}(t) = \sum_{n=-N}^N X_n^{(i)} e^{j \omega_0 t},
\end{equation}

the derivative has the form

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:ece1254projectReport:520}
\dot{x^{(i)}}(t) = j \omega_0 \sum_{n=-N}^N X_n^{(i)} n e^{j \omega_0 t}.
\end{equation}

The Fourier component representation of the MNA equations can be written as

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:ece1254projectReport:600}
\begin{aligned}
0 = \sum_{n = -N}^N e^{j \omega_0 n t}
&\Biglr{
   \lr{ \BG + j \omega_0 n \BC } 
\begin{bmatrix}
X_n^{(1)} \\
X_n^{(2)} \\
\vdots \\
\end{bmatrix} \\
   &- \BB 
\begin{bmatrix}
U_n^{(1)} \\
U_n^{(2)} \\
\vdots \\
\end{bmatrix}
   - \BD 
\begin{bmatrix}
W_n^{(1)} \\
W_n^{(2)} \\
\vdots \\
\end{bmatrix}
}.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

All the time dependence is moved into the exponentials.  
Given the 
assumption of periodicity, each of these equations must separately equal zero for each \( ( n, i ) \) pair, or

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:ece1254projectReport:540}
\lr{
\BG + j \omega_0 n \BC
}
\begin{bmatrix}
V_n^{(1)} \\
V_n^{(2)} \\
\vdots \\
\end{bmatrix}
=
\BB
\begin{bmatrix}
U_n^{(1)} \\
U_n^{(2)} \\
\vdots \\
\end{bmatrix}
+\BD
\begin{bmatrix}
W_n^{(1)} \\
W_n^{(2)} \\
\vdots \\
\end{bmatrix}.
\end{dmath}

FIXME: describe block matrix formulation next.

\section{Results}

Simulation results for a few representive circuit types are given below

\begin{itemize}
\item Simple rectifier circuit \cref{fig:simpleRectifierCircuit:simpleRectifierCircuit}.
\item Typical rectifier circuit \cref{fig:typicalRectifierCircuit:typicalRectifierCircuit}.
\item Low pass filter, Cut off Frequency is 5 MHz, Input Frequencies are 1 and 8 MHz \cref{fig:lowPassFilter:lowPassFilter}.

In the plots of cputime and error vs N, the error is the biggest difference between the solution for the N in question compared to a ``sufficiently large'' value of N (100).

% However, the Computer Society has been known to put floats at the bottom.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.

%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the 
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells

%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\

%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals use top floats exclusively.
% However, Computer Society journals sometimes do use bottom floats - bear
% this in mind when choosing appropriate optional arguments for the
% figure/table environments.
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals, places footnotes above bottom
% floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat command of the
% stfloats package.



\section{Conclusion}

%%%% or
%%%%\appendix  % for no appendix heading
%%%% do not use \section anymore after \appendix, only \section*
%%%% is possibly needed
%%%
%%%
%%%% use appendices with more than one appendix
%%%% then use \section to start each appendix
%%%% you must declare a \section before using any
%%%% \subsection or using \label (\appendices by itself
%%%% starts a section numbered zero.)

\section{Discrete Fourier Transform inversion}
\label{appendix:discreteFourierInversion}

To find \( X_n \) evaluate the sum

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:ece1254projectReport:80}
\begin{aligned}
\sum_{k = -N}^N &x(t_k) e^{-j m \omega_0 t_k} \\
&=
\sum_{k = -N}^N 
\lr{
\sum_{n = -N}^N X_n e^{ j n \omega_0 t_k}
}
e^{-j m \omega_0 t_k} \\
&=
\sum_{n = -N}^N X_n 
\sum_{k = -N}^N 
e^{ j (n -m )\omega_0 t_k}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

This interior sum has the value \( 2 N + 1 \) when \( n = m \).  For \( n \ne m \), and 
\( a = e^{j (n -m ) \frac{2 \pi}{2 N + 1}} \), this is

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:ece1254projectReport:100}
\sum_{k = -N}^N 
e^{ j (n -m )\omega_0 t_k}
=
\sum_{k = -N}^N 
e^{ j (n -m )\omega_0 \frac{T k}{2 N + 1}}
=
\sum_{k = -N}^N a^k
=
a^{-N} \sum_{k = -N}^N a^{k+ N}
=
a^{-N} \sum_{r = 0}^{2 N} a^{r}
=
a^{-N} \frac{a^{2 N + 1} - 1}{a - 1}.
\end{dmath}

Since \( a^{2 N + 1} = e^{2 \pi j (n - m)} = 1 \), this sum is zero when \( n \ne m \).  This means that

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:ece1254projectReport:120}
\sum_{k = -N}^N 
e^{ j (n -m )\omega_0 t_k} = (2 N + 1) \delta_{n,m}.
\end{equation}

Substitution back into \cref{eqn:ece1254projectReport:80} proves the Fourier inversion relation \cref{eqn:ece1254projectReport:60}.
