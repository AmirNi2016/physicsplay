- bold matrices used in problem set 2a, but not other class notes.

- not much indexing past first couple lectures.

- format matlab function names in a monospace font. (problem descriptions and solutions).  Introduce a layout newcommand for this, and replace the manual markup uses in some places.

- maybe also purge pretentious:

   grep -nie '\<thus\>' *.tex | tee v
   grep -nie '\<therefore\>' *.tex | tee v

- have a mix of bold and non-bold case for matrices.

- am using \textrm{} for a couple text subscripts, but not many.  do a consistency check.

- regenerate circuit figures using digikey.ca (can save as pdfs).

- enclose algorithms in figure environment so they can be captioned?

- revisit gergorshwin circles issue from correspondence.  (off real axis eigenvalues).
