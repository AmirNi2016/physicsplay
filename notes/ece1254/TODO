- format matlab functions like: http://msenux.redwoods.edu/Math4Textbook?

   believe that I had at least one listing too, which would be nice to format with their method.  See if they get back to me about their macros.

- In the report, have circuit diagrams flagged with matlab paths.

- Are all the matlab figures done with mathImageFigure?

- have a mix of bold and non-bold case for matrices.
   : bold matrices used in problem set 2a, but not in all places.

- format matlab function names in a monospace font. (problem descriptions and solutions).  Introduce a layout newcommand for this, and replace the manual markup uses in some places.

- maybe also purge pretentious:

   grep -nie '\<thus\>' *.tex | tee v
   grep -nie '\<therefore\>' *.tex | tee v

- am using \textrm{} for a couple text subscripts, but not many.  do a consistency check.

- regenerate circuit figures using digikey.ca (can save as pdfs).

   Equivalent circuit
   Find a simplified model that has the same input-output characteristics
   Equivalent circuit for heat equation
   Initial node
   Terminal node
   Alternate modeling of the boundary value constraints.

- do I have a mix of href's and hyperref's for matlab files (some files like ps1.circuit.netlist are href'd).
