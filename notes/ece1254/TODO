- have a mix of bold and non-bold case for matrices.
   : bold matrices used in problem set 2a, but not in all places.

Nice to haves:

- maybe also purge pretentious:

   grep -nie '\<thus\>' *.tex | tee v
   grep -nie '\<therefore\>' *.tex | tee v

- could regenerate circuit figures using digikey.ca (can save as pdfs).

   Equivalent circuit
   Find a simplified model that has the same input-output characteristics
   Equivalent circuit for heat equation
   Initial node
   Terminal node
   Alternate modeling of the boundary value constraints.
