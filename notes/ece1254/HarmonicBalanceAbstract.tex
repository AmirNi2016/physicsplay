With this work the Matlab based circuit solution system developed in ECE1254 for linear constant source RLC circuits is extended to compute steady state responses to periodic sources, to include support for a simple non-linear diode model, and to include support for Taylor expanded conductance circuit elements.
It is assumed that all input frequencies are multiples of a single fundamental frequency.
Anharmonic effects will be ignored, and it will be assumed that only periodic outputs with harmonics that are multiples of the input frequencies will be observed.
The solution utilizes the \emph{Harmonic Balance} method described in \citep{giannini2004NonlinearMicrowaveCircuitDesign}, where
time variation of the inputs and outputs is expressed as discrete time Fourier series expressed in a matrix form that can be handled readily by software.
