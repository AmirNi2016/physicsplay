This document will probably contain a few things

\begin{itemize}
\item My personal lecture notes for the Fall 2011, University of Toronto Quantum mechanics II course (PHY456H1F), taught by Prof.\ John E Sipe.

Typos, if any, are probably mine (Peeter), and no claim nor attempt of spelling or grammar correctness will be made.

\item Notes from reading of the text \citep{desai2009quantum}.  .  This includes observations, notes on what seem like errors, and some solved problems.

\item Some assigned problems.  I've corrected some the errors after recieving grading feedback, and where I haven't done so I at least recorded some of the grading comments as a reference.

\item Some worked problems associated with exam preparation.

\end{itemize}
