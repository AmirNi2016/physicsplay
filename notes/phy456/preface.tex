This document will probably contain a few things

\begin{itemize}
\item My personal lecture notes for the Fall 2011, University of Toronto Quantum mechanics II course (PHY456H1F), taught by Prof.\ John E Sipe.

Typos, if any, are probably mine (Peeter), and no claim nor attempt of spelling or grammar correctness will be made.

\item Notes from reading of the text \citep{desai2009quantum}.  This may include observations, notes on what seem like errors, and some solved problems.

\item Different ways of tackling some of the assigned problems than the solution sets.

\item Some worked problems associated with exam or test preparation.

\end{itemize}
