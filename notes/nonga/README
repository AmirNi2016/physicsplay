Steps:

- convert title to chapter
- deal with local macros and commands.
- Add to Makefile gabook.tex
- convert internal citations to chapter references.
- symlink figures :     grep includegraphics XX.tex

- remove references from ../geometric-algebra/Makefile
- remove references from webpages.

- shorten titles.

- take repeated newcommand stuff and move to peeters_macros3.tex

  probably do this first based on ../gabook/

- applies here?

  some of my topic pages had discussion bits that might be nice to incorporate
  as chapter heading pages.
