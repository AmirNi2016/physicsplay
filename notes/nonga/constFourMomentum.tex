\section{Motivation}

Considering the Euler-Lagrange solutions for the relativistic force free covariant Lagrangian

\begin{align}\label{eqn:constFourMomentum:qqq1}
\LL &= \inv{2} m \xdot^\mu \xdot_\mu \\
\xdot^\mu &= \frac{d x^\mu}{d \tau},
\end{align}

we get a set of four constant momentum equations

\begin{align}\label{eqn:constFourMomentum:qqq5}
m \xdot_\mu = m v_\mu(0).
\end{align}

Can we make some sense of this?  While this seems natural enough in comparision to Newtonian physics, we just add a component when switching to a four vector representation, the $\gamma$ factors that one may expect are nowhere obvious to be seen.  

\section{Guts}

A decomposition into an explicit spacetime split looks like it is the first step along the path to resolves this

\begin{align}\label{eqn:constFourMomentum:qqq6}
X \equiv (c t, \Bx) = (ct, x^1, x^2, x^3).
\end{align}

Considering first the time component of our equations of motion we have

\begin{align}\label{eqn:constFourMomentum:qqq7}
m c \frac{dt}{d\tau} = m v_0(0).
\end{align}

Or 
\begin{align}\label{eqn:constFourMomentum:qqq8}
\frac{dt}{d\tau} = \frac{v_0(0)}{c}.
\end{align}

For the spatial components we have

\begin{align*}
m \frac{d x_k}{d\tau} 
&=
m \frac{d x_k}{dt}  \frac{dt}{d\tau} \\
&=
m \frac{d x_k}{dt}  \frac{v_0(0)}{c}.
\end{align*}

With a switch to upper indexes, the remaining three equations of motion are then just

\begin{align}\label{eqn:constFourMomentum:qqq10}
\frac{d x^k}{dt} = c \frac{ v^k(0) }{ v_0(0) }.
\end{align}

Or
\begin{align}\label{eqn:constFourMomentum:qqq10a}
\frac{d \Bv}{dt} = c \frac{ \Bv(0) }{ v_0(0) }.
\end{align}

The math seems to be saying that relativistically, in the abscence of forces, we have constant velocity in our rest frame.  This constant velocity is relative to the initial time component of the four velocity.  This is not what I would have expected from the relativisitically corrected Newtons laws in three vector form

\begin{align}\label{eqn:constFourMomentum:qqq11}
\BF = \frac{d}{dt}\left( \frac{m \Bv}{\sqrt{1 - (\Bv/c)^2}} \right).
\end{align}

In this equation it appears that we should only expect constant velocity in the small speed limit where $\Bv/c$ can be neglected.  In retrospect it doesn't neccessarily make sense to expect that taking the time derivative of just the spatial component of the ``force'' should behave in any sort of relativisticly nice fashion.  This is an intrinsically unfriendly seeming thing to do in a relativistic context.  How do we reconsile the two?

%However, further comparing the covariant result for spatial velocity \ref{eqn:constFourMomentum:qqq10}, with \ref{eqn:constFourMomentum:qqq11}, we see that for equality we must have

%WRONG.  WTF?
