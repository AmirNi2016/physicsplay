\section{ Bra and Ket vectors. }

An odd looking vector notation is introduced.  Instead of just using a letter, say $A$, for a vector in \C{N}, such a
vector is instead written

\begin{align*}
\ket{A}
\end{align*}

This is called a ``ket'' or ket-vector, but really just means complex vector.   The complex conjugate of this
vector is then written as a ``bra'' like so

\begin{align*}
\bra{A}
\end{align*}

The inner product of two vectors can then be written by combining this bra and ket by butting them up together, as
in

\begin{align*}
\braket{A}{B}
\end{align*}

Contrast this to the explicit complex column vector representation

\begin{align*}
{A} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
a_1 \\
a_2 \\
\vdots \\
a_n
\end{bmatrix}
\quad
{B} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
b_1 \\
b_2 \\
\vdots \\
b_n
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}

in a finite dimensional space.  The usual convention is to employ an inner product notation like

\begin{align*}
\innerprod{A}{B} = {A}^\text{T} \bar{B} = \sum_i {a_i} \bar{b_i}
\end{align*}

or,
\begin{align*}
\innerprod{A}{B} = {A}^\conj {B} = \sum_i \bar{a_i} {b_i}
\end{align*}

Observe that the braket notation is closer to this last form with the conjugation on the first term.  However, note that the metric associated with the braket notation has not been specified yet.  This is in fact an integral over space, where the ket vectors are complex valued functions.

\subsection{ Proper characterization as momentum. }

There is a discussion in the lectures mentioning that a wave function that is peaked at a position in space
corresponds to the position of a particle in an approximate, but intuitively reasonable seeming fashion.

It is mentioned however, to properly show the same sort of characterization for the 
equivalence of the QM momentum construction and momentum of classical
physics requires the consideration of a (large and massive) wave packet.  It can be shown that the equations that
govern the motion
of such an object approximate familiar newtonian dynamics in this limit.  It will be interesting to see how
this pans out.  My assumption is that if we start from the relativistic (Dirac) wave equations, we can also
get the relativistic dynamics equations, and presumably also ideas like the classical current density vector
of electromagnetism.  Very exciting to see that it is at least possible to formulate the classical results from
more fundamental underlying principles, even if I don't know what those are yet.  How will all of this relate 
to the Lagrangian formulation that we can express newtonian and relativistic dynamics and electromagnetism using.
Can one in fact produce the classical Lagrangians for (proper) Lorentz force, and Maxwell's equation (or at least the $A \cdot J$ term) directly from the QM Lagrangians?
