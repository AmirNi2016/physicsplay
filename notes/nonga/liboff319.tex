\section{Problem 3.19.}

\citep{liboff2003iqm} problem 3.19 is

What is the effect of operating on an arbitrary function $f(x)$ with the following two operators

\begin{subequations}
\label{eqn:liboff319:1}
\begin{align}
\hat{O}_1 &\equiv \partial^2/\partial x^2 - 1 
+ sin^2 (\partial^3/\partial x^3)
+ cos^2 (\partial^3/\partial x^3) \\
\hat{O}_2 &\equiv 
+ cos (2 \partial/\partial x) 
+ sin^2 (\partial/\partial x)
+ \int_a^b dx
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

On the surface with $\sin^2 y + \cos^2 y = 1$ and $\cos 2y + 2 \sin^2 y = 1$ it appears that we have just
\begin{subequations}
\label{eqn:liboff319:2}
\begin{align}
\hat{O}_1 &\equiv \partial^2/\partial x^2  \\
\hat{O}_2 &\equiv 1 + \int_a^b dx
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

but it this justified when the sinusoids are functions of operators?  Let's look at the first case.  For some operator $\hat{f}$ we have

\begin{align*}
\sin^2 \hat{f} + \cos^2 \hat{f}
&=
-\inv{4} \left( 
e^{i\hat{f}} -e^{-i\hat{f}}
\right)
\left( 
e^{i\hat{f}} -e^{-i\hat{f}}
\right)
+\inv{4} \left( 
e^{i\hat{f}} +e^{-i\hat{f}}
\right)
\left( 
e^{i\hat{f}} +e^{-i\hat{f}}
\right) \\
&=
\inv{2} \left(
e^{i\hat{f}} e^{-i\hat{f}} +e^{-i\hat{f}} e^{i\hat{f}}
\right)
\end{align*}

Can we assume that these cancel for general operators?  How about for our specific differential operator $\hat{f} = \partial^3/\partial x^3$?  For that one we have

\begin{align*}
e^{i \partial^3/\partial x^3} e^{-i \partial^3/\partial x^3} g(x)
&=
\sum_{k=0}^\infty 
\inv{k!} 
\left(\frac{\partial^3}{\partial x^3}\right)^k
\sum_{m=0}^\infty 
\inv{m!} 
\left(\frac{\partial^3}{\partial x^3}\right)^m g(x)
\end{align*}

Since the differentials commute, so do the exponentials and we can write the slightly simpler

\begin{align*}
\sin^2 \hat{f} + \cos^2 \hat{f} = e^{i\hat{f}} e^{-i\hat{f}} 
\end{align*}

I'm pretty sure the commutative property of this differential operator would also allow us to say (in this case at least)

\begin{align*}
\sin^2 \hat{f} + \cos^2 \hat{f} = 1
\end{align*}

Will have to look up the combinatoric argument that allows one to write, for numbers,

\begin{align*}
e^x e^y = 
\sum_{k=0}^\infty 
\inv{k!} x^k 
\sum_{m=0}^\infty 
\inv{m!} y^m 
=
\sum_{j=0}^\infty 
\inv{j!} (x+y)^j 
= e^{x+y}
\end{align*}

If this only assumes that $x$ and $y$ commute, and not any other numeric properties then we have the supposed result \ref{eqn:liboff319:2}.  We also know of algebraic objects where this does not hold.  One example is exponentials of non-commuting square matrices, and other is non-commuting bivector exponentials.
