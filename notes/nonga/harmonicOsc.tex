\section{ Motivation. }

In \cite{byron1992mca} (chapter II), an operator solution to the
(one dimensional) quantum
harmonic oscillator problem is presented.  Try this in a more old fashioned way,
as a comparision.

We want to solve the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for a quadratic potential

\begin{align}\label{eqn:toSolve}
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \psi + \inv{2} m \omega^2 x^2 \psi = i \hbar \PD{t}{\psi}
\end{align}

\section{ Setup. }

\subsection{ Separation of variables. }

Equation \ref{eqn:toSolve} is separable, and to do so we can write

\begin{align*}
\psi(x,t) = \phi(x) T(t)
\end{align*}

and procede to form the separated equation

\begin{align*}
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\phi''}{\phi} + \inv{2} m \omega^2 x^2 = i \hbar \frac{T'}{T} = \text{constant}
\end{align*}

Writing $E$ for the constant, the and solving for the time function we have

\begin{align*}
(\ln(T))' &= -i \frac{E}{\hbar} \\
\implies \\
\ln(T) &= -i \frac{Et}{\hbar} + \ln(A)
\end{align*}

where $A$ is some constant.  This yields

\begin{align*}
T(t) = A e^{ -i E t/\hbar }
\end{align*}

What remains is now to solve the spatial wave equation

\begin{align}\label{eqn:spatial}
\phi'' + \left( \frac{m^2 \omega^2}{\hbar^2} x^2 - \frac{2m E}{\hbar^2}\right) \phi = 0
\end{align}

This doesn't really look too much like the harmonic oscillator problem of classical physics.  Let's remind ourself
what that was like before continuing.

\subsection{ Mass on a spring. }

The harmonic oscillator problem from classical physics
shows up many times, and is usually first seen when examining motion
of a mass on a spring.  There we have a restoring force that accelerates the
mass in the opposite direction from its equibrium position

\begin{align}
m \xddot = -k x
\end{align}

This has two complex exponential solutions.  With a substitution of the test function

\begin{align*}
x = e^{i \omega t}
\end{align*}

we have

\begin{align*}
(-m \omega^2 + k) e^{i \omega t} = 0
\end{align*}

So the test function is a solution provided

\begin{align*}
\omega^2 = \frac{k}{m}
\end{align*}

That doesn't really help understanding why \ref{eqn:spatial} is labelled the Harmonic oscillator.  Let's instead put the equation into an energy form.  The work done against the spring
(potential energy to be returned when the mass is released) is

\begin{align*}
W 
&= - \int F \cdot dx \\
&= - \int -kx dx \\
&= \inv{2} k (x^2 - x_0^2)
\end{align*}

So, our Lagrangian is

\begin{align*}
\LL = \inv{2}m \xdot^2 - \inv{2} k (x^2 - x_0^2)
\end{align*}

The constant term in the potential can be dropped, since it won't contribute to the equations of motion.  Our conjugate momentum $\PDi{\xdot}{\LL}$ is just $m \xdot$, and the Hamiltonian
is therefore

\begin{align*}
H 
&= \xdot \PD{\xdot}{\LL} - \LL \\
&= m \xdot^2  - \left( \inv{2}m \xdot^2 - \inv{2} k x^2 \right) \\
&= \inv{2} m \xdot^2  + \inv{2} k x^2 \\
\end{align*}

Or

\begin{align*}
H &= \frac{p^2}{2 m } + \inv{2} m \omega^2 x^2 \\
\end{align*}

Ah.  In this form we see the structure of the QM Harmonic oscillator equation.  With the position space representation of the momentum operator $p \sim -i \hbar \PDi{x}{}$ we have
something now similar to \ref{eqn:toSolve}.

\section{ Series solution. }

\subsection{ Assuming Gaussian solutions. }

Having seen the operator solution of the QM harmonic oscillator problem, we will cheat, and use that as a starting point.  Assume that
the solution can be expressed as a scaled Gaussian as in

\begin{align}
\phi(x) &= f(x) e^{ - \alpha x^2/2 }
\end{align}

\begin{align*}
\phi'(x) &= \left( f'(x) - \alpha x f(x) \right) e^{ - \alpha x^2/2 } \\
\phi''(x)
&=
\left( f''(x) - \alpha f(x) -\alpha x f'(x) \right) e^{ - \alpha x^2/2 }
\left( f'(x) - \alpha x f(x) \right) (-\alpha x) e^{ - \alpha x^2/2 } \\
&=
\left( f''(x) - \alpha f(x) - 2 \alpha x f'(x) + \alpha^2 x^2 f(x) \right) e^{ - \alpha x^2/2 }
\end{align*}

Substitution of the scaled Gaussian test solution, and its derivatives, gives us

\begin{align*}
\left( f'' - \alpha f - 2 \alpha x f' + \alpha^2 x^2 f + \left( \frac{m^2 \omega^2}{\hbar^2} x^2 - \frac{2 m E}{\hbar^2} \right) f \right) e^{ -\alpha x^2 /2} = 0
\end{align*}

Since the exponential is never zero, this requires a zero for the differential equation

\begin{align}
f'' - 2 \alpha x f' + \left( \left(\alpha^2 + \frac{m^2 \omega^2}{\hbar^2} \right) x^2 - \left(\frac{2 m E}{\hbar^2} + \alpha \right) \right) f = 0
\end{align}

Compared to \ref{eqn:spatial}, this doesn't really appear to be much of an improvement, but let's work with it, looking for a term by term power series solution.

Assuming various power series solutions of the form

\begin{align*}
f_n(x) &= \sum_{r=0}^n a_r x^r
\end{align*}

derivatives are
\begin{align*}
f_n' &= \sum_{r=0}^n r a_r x^{r-1} \\
f_n'' &= \sum_{r=0}^n r(r-1) a_r x^{r-2}
\end{align*}

We have 
\begin{align*}
0 &= \sum_{r=0}^{n-2} (r+2)(r+1) a_{r+2} x^{r}
 - 2 \alpha \sum_{r=1}^n r a_r x^{r}
+ \left(\alpha^2 + \frac{m^2 \omega^2}{\hbar^2} \right) \sum_{r=0}^n a_r x^{r+2}
- \left(\frac{2 m E}{\hbar^2} + \alpha \right) \sum_{r=0}^n a_r x^r
\end{align*}

This should be enough to figure out recurrence relations for the various constants in the polynomials.
