\section{Motivation}

In \chapcite{PJpoisson} I blundered my way towards the retarded time Green's function solution to the 3D wave equation.  Jackson \cite{jackson1975cew} (section 12.11) does this in a nice compact fashion, but because of some omitted details parts are hard to follow.

Here are some reader notes for this section.
