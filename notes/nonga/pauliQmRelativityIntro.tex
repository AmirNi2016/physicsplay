\section{ Motivation. }

In \cite{pauli2000wm} a few relativity notes are made to build up to 
a relativistic wave equation (ie: the Klien-Gordon equation),
and show one can introduce a non-relativistic approximation of this
that has close to the form of a the free particle \Sch equation.  It 
is interesting to see things use relativity as a base.  This is exactly
opposite to the Klien-Gordon treatment in a text such as
\cite{srednicki2007qft} where a way to find a 
relativistically correct form starting from the \Sch equation is searched for.

Pauli's treatment is a bit too terse for me, but has a number of
interesting and illuminating features.  He also uses $h$ for $\hbar$
which is disorienting.  Here I reiterate his treatment in my own words to
verify my understanding, and to refer to later when revisiting his
text.
