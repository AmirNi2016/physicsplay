\section{ Motivation. }

In \cite{pauli2000wm} a few relativity notes are made to build up to 
a relativistic wave equation (ie: the Klien-Gordon equation),
and show one can introduce a non-relativistic approximation of this
that has close to the form of a the free particle \Sch equation.  It 
is interesting to see things use relativity as a base.  This is exactly
opposite to the Klien-Gordon treatment in a text such as
\cite{srednicki2007qft} where a way to find a 
relativistically correct form starting from the \Sch equation is searched for.

Pauli's treatment is a bit too terse for me, but has a number of
interesting and illuminating features.  He also uses $h$ for $\hbar$
which is disorienting.  Here I reiterate his treatment in my own words to
verify my understanding, and to refer to later when revisiting his
text.

\section{ Relativistic mechanics. }

\subsection{ Energy in terms of momentum. }

Equation $1.4$ is the famous energy and momentum equations

\begin{align*}
E &= \frac{ m c^2 }{\sqrt{1 - \Bv^2/c^2}} \\
\Bp &= \frac{ m \Bv }{\sqrt{1 - \Bv^2/c^2}} \\
\end{align*}

These pair of these quantities is often now expressed as a four vector in various ways

\begin{align*}
p &= (\frac{E}{c}, \Bp \gamma_0) \\
p &= \frac{E}{c} \gamma_0 + \Bp \gamma_0 \\
\cdots
\end{align*}

Pauli notes that the two separate energy momentum quantities can be combined into a single scalar invariant

\begin{align*}
\Bp^2 + m^2 c^2 
&= \frac{ m^2 \Bv^2 }{{1 - \Bv^2/c^2}} +  \frac{ m^2 c^2( 1 - \Bv^2/c^2) }{{1 - \Bv^2/c^2}}  \\
&= \inv{1 - \Bv^2/c^2} m^2 \left( \Bv^2 + c^2( 1 - \Bv^2/c^2) \right) \\
&= \inv{1 - \Bv^2/c^2} m^2 \left( \Bv^2 + c^2 - \Bv^2 \right) \\
&= \inv{1 - \Bv^2/c^2} m^2 c^2 \\
\end{align*}

Which recovers his equation $1.3$ (in the square)

\begin{align}\label{eqn:p1_3}
\frac{E^2}{c^2} = \Bp^2 + m^2 c^2 
\end{align}

\subsection{ Energy-momentum four vector from Energy }

Now, interestingly, Pauli also points out that his equation \ref{eqn:p1_3} can be used to derive the four vector
equations for energy and momentum, only requiring one express the relationship between Kinetic energy and momentum
as one would do in plain old non-relativistic physics.  That is, starting with

\begin{align*}
E &= \inv{2} m \Bv^2 \\
\end{align*}

differentiation with respect to some parameter we can write

\begin{align*}
\frac{dE}{d\alpha} 
&= m \Bv \cdot \frac{d\Bv}{d\alpha} \\
&= \Bv \cdot \frac{d\Bp}{d\alpha} \\
\end{align*}

If the specific parameterization of the path is implied we have

\begin{align}\label{eqn:EvP}
{dE} &= \Bv \cdot {d\Bp}.
\end{align}

In coordinates this gives

\begin{align*}
{dE} &= \sum_k v_k dp_k \\
\end{align*}

Pauli uses this to express the velocity coordinates in terms of energy and momentum, and writes

\begin{align}\label{eqn:vEp}
v_k &= \PD{p_k}{E}
\end{align}

My way of getting this seems a bit fishy (he goes from \ref{eqn:EvP} to \ref{eqn:vEp} directly), but it doesn't appear too unreasonable once one gets the final result.

Assuming \ref{eqn:vEp} is valid and applying this to \ref{eqn:p1_3}, it is relatively straightforward to
recover the four-vector energy-momentum equations.  

From
\begin{align*}
E &= \sqrt{\Bp^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4 } \\
\end{align*}

we calculate
\begin{align*}
v_k 
&= \PD{p_k}{E} \\
&= (2 p_k c^2) \inv{2} \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Bp^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4 }}
&= c^2 \frac{p_k}{E}
\end{align*}

Summing over all components
\begin{align*}
\frac{\Bv^2}{c^2} 
&= \sum_k (v_k)^2/c^2 \\
&= c^2 \frac{p_k^2}{E^2}
\end{align*}
