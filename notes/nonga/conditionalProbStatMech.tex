\section{A bit of confusion.}

In \cite{jackson2000equilibrium} \S 1.5 while discussing statistical uncertainty is a mention of conditional probability.  Once told that a die only rolls numbers up to four, we have a conditional probability for the die of

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:conditionalProbStatMech:10}
P(i | i \le 4) = 
\frac{P[i U(i \le 4)]}{P(i \le 4)}
= \frac{\inv{6}}{\frac{4}{6}} = \inv{4}.
\end{equation}

I was having trouble understanding the numerator in this expression.  An initial confusion was, ``what is this U''.  I came to the conclusion that this is just a typo, and was meant to be set intersection, as in

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:conditionalProbStatMech:30}
P(i | i \le 4) = 
\frac{P[i \cap (i \le 4)]}{P(i \le 4)}
= \frac{\inv{6}}{\frac{4}{6}} = \inv{4}.
\end{equation}

The denominator makes sense.  I picture a sample space with 6 points as in figure (\ref{fig:conditionalProbStatMechalProbStatMechFig1})
\begin{figure}[htp]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[totalheight=0.2\textheight]{conditionalProbStatMechFig1}
   \caption{Sample space for a die.}\label{fig:conditionalProbStatMechalProbStatMechFig1}
\end{figure}

The points 1,2,3,4 represent the $i \le 4$ subspace, as in figure (\ref{fig:conditionalProbStatMechalProbStatMechFig2})
\begin{figure}[htp]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[totalheight=0.2\textheight]{conditionalProbStatMechFig2}
   \caption{$i \le 4$ compound event.}\label{fig:conditionalProbStatMechalProbStatMechFig2}
\end{figure}

So we have a $4/6$ probability for that compound event.

I found it easy to get mixed up considering the numerator.  I was envisioning, as in figure (\ref{fig:conditionalProbStatMech:conditionalProbStatMechFig3})
\begin{figure}[htp]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[totalheight=0.2\textheight]{conditionalProbStatMechFig3}
   \caption{Incorrect depiction of $i \cap (i \le 4)$ compound event.}\label{fig:conditionalProbStatMech:conditionalProbStatMechFig3}
\end{figure}

a set of six intersecting with the set of points $1,2,3,4$, which is just that set of four.  To clear up the confusion, imagine instead that we are asking about the probability of finding the $i = 2$ face in the dice roll, given the fact that the die only rolls $i = 1, 2, 3, 4$.  Our intersection sample space for that event is then shown in figure (\ref{fig:conditionalProbStatMech:conditionalProbStatMechFig4})
\begin{figure}[htp]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[totalheight=0.2\textheight]{conditionalProbStatMechFig4}
   \caption{Intersection of the $i = 2$ and $i \le 4$ events.}\label{fig:conditionalProbStatMech:conditionalProbStatMechFig4}
\end{figure}

The intersection is just the single point, so we have a $1/6$ probability for that compound event.  The final result makes sense, since if we are looking for the probability for any of the $i = 1, 2, 3, 4$ events given that the die will only roll one of these values, we should have a value of $1/4$ as found through the compound probability formula.
