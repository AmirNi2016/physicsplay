\section{Motivation}

I've now seen Hamiltonians used, mostly in a Quantum Context, and think that I understand at least some of the math associated with the Hamiltonian and the Hamiltonian principle.  I have, however, not used either of these enough that it seems natural to do so.

Here I attempt to summarize for myself what I know about Hamiltonians, work through a number of examples, some of which I've done already using the Lagrangian formalism.

\section{Hamiltonian as a conserved quantity.}

Starting with the Lagrangian formalism the Hamiltonian can be found as a conserved quantity associated with time translation when the Lagrangian has no explicit time dependence.  This follows directly by considering the time derivative of the Lagrangian
