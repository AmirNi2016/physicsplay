\section{ Motivation. }

Reading of the proof of chapter 3, eqn 12.7, in \cite{pauli2000wm},
that the anti-commutator 

\begin{align*}
\symmetric{F}{G} = {F G + G F}
\end{align*}

is Hermitian, is unclear to me.  Fill in the missing details.  Also prove that 

\begin{align*}
i \antisymmetric{F}{G} = i (F G - G F)
\end{align*}

is Hermitian.

\section{ Future: Relation to clifford product. }

For vector spaces, as noted in \cite{PJpauliMatrix},
we can write the clifford product of two \R{N} vectors in terms of commutators and anti-commutators

\begin{align*}
\Bf \Bg = \inv{2} \left( \symmetric{\Bf}{\Bg} + i \antisymmetric{\Bf}{\Bg} \right)
\end{align*}

where $i$ is the pseudoscalar for the space.  So, while $FG$ isn't neccessarily Hermitian, it is interesting that the composite operator
$\symmetric{F}{G} + i \antisymmetric{F}{G}$, which is so close to the product operator of Euclidian vector spaces, is Hermitian.
Explore this geometric analogy later.
