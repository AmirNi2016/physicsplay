\section{ Motivation. }

While working a problem with an induction requirement similar to but more 
complicated than the binomial theorem, I steped back and thought I'd try
this as an easier first step.  Had some trouble doing it, until I tried it
explicitly with for the power of three case.  Ironically, working it
out for an explicit index takes the abstraction out of the problem, and
generalizing further really only requires a search and replace.

\section{ Do it. }

Want to prove

\begin{align}
(t + x)^k = \sum_{m=0}^k \binom{k}{m} t^m x^{k-m}
\end{align}

where

\begin{align}
\binom{k}{m} = \frac{k!}{(k-m)!m!}
\end{align}

In particular want to prove this for the $k+1$ case, given $k$.

\subsection{ step with k+1 = 3 }

Three isn't actually the best way to start since it is almost too trivial, but
one gets the idea easily by doing it.

\begin{align*}
(t + x)^3 
&= (t + x)(t + x)^2  \\
&= (t + x)\sum_{m=0}^2 \binom{2}{m} t^m x^{2-m} \\
&= 
\sum_{m=0}^2 \binom{2}{m} t^{m+1} x^{2-m} 
+ \sum_{m=0}^2 \binom{2}{m} t^{m} x^{2-m + 1} \\
&= 
\sum_{m=1}^{2 + 1} \binom{2}{m-1} t^{m} x^{2 - m + 1} 
+ \sum_{m=0}^2 \binom{2}{m} t^{m} x^{2-m + 1} \\
\end{align*}

Now pull the lowest and highest order terms out of the sums, and group the
remaining bits.

\begin{align*}
(t + x)^3 
&= 
 \binom{2}{0} t^{0} x^{2 - 0 + 1} 
+ \sum_{m=1}^{2} \left( \binom{2}{m} + \binom{2}{m-1} \right) t^{m} x^{2 - m + 1} 
+ \binom{2}{2 + 1 -1} t^{2 + 1} x^{2 - (2 + 1) + 1} 
\\
\end{align*}

Now, observe that in all the steps above everywhere if all places that $2$, a nice easy to think with and concrete number, we could have used some
abstract index.

\subsection{ step with k+1 }

A straight text search and replace on $2$ with $k$ gives

\begin{align*}
(t + x)^{k+1}
&= (t + x)(t + x)^k  \\
&= (t + x)\sum_{m=0}^k \binom{k}{m} t^m x^{k-m} \\
&= 
\sum_{m=0}^k \binom{k}{m} t^{m+1} x^{k-m} 
+ \sum_{m=0}^k \binom{k}{m} t^{m} x^{k-m + 1} \\
&= 
\sum_{m=1}^{k + 1} \binom{k}{m-1} t^{m} x^{k - m + 1} 
+ \sum_{m=0}^k \binom{k}{m} t^{m} x^{k-m + 1} \\
&= 
 \binom{k}{0} t^{0} x^{k - 0 + 1} 
+ \sum_{m=1}^{k} \left( \binom{k}{m} + \binom{k}{m-1} \right) t^{m} x^{k - m + 1} 
+ \binom{k}{k + 1 -1} t^{k + 1} x^{k - (k + 1) + 1} \\
\end{align*}

This is EXACTLY the same as above with $k=2$ but it sure looks more complicated with an an abstract index.

To finish off we need a couple observations, that 
$\binom{k}{0} = 1 = \binom{k+1}{0}$, and $\binom{k}{k} = 1 = \binom{k+1}{k+1}$.  This leaves us with

\begin{align*}
(t + x)^{k+1}
= \binom{k+1}{0} t^{0} x^{k + 1} 
+ \sum_{m=1}^{k} \left( \binom{k}{m} + \binom{k}{m-1} \right) t^{m} x^{k - m + 1} 
+ \binom{k + 1}{k + 1} t^{k + 1} x^{0} \\
\end{align*}

So if we can show
\begin{align*}
\binom{k}{m} + \binom{k}{m-1} = \binom{k+1}{m}
\end{align*}

then we would have

\begin{align*}
(t + x)^{k+1}
&= \sum_{m=0}^{k+1} \binom{k+1}{m} t^{m} x^{k + 1 - m} 
\end{align*}

which is what was desired.
