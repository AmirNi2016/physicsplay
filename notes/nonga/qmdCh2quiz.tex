\section{ Problem 1. Separation of variables. }

This problem was to show that separation of variables leads to an exponential energy/phase
term.  Let's try this, but do it instead for three dimensions and explore a bit.

We try a test solution of the form

\begin{align*}
\phi &= X(x) Y(y) Z(z) T(t) \\
\end{align*}

and substitute into 

\begin{align*}
\left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\grad^2 + V\right) \phi &= i \hbar \partial_t \phi
\end{align*}

differentiating and dividing by $\phi$ we have
\begin{align*}
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}
\left(
\frac{X''}{X}
+\frac{Y''}{Y}
+\frac{Z''}{Z}
\right)
 + V &= i \hbar \frac{T'}{T}
\end{align*}

We set the right hand side equal to a constant $E$ to be determined by boundary value conditions.
According to the dimensionals of $V$ this $E$ constant can be seen to neccessarily be an energy
of some sort.  In terms of this energy, we have for the function $T$

\begin{align*}
i \hbar \frac{T'}{T} &= E
\end{align*}

With a solution of
\begin{align*}
T(t) &= e^{-i E t/\hbar}
\end{align*}

Now, the left hand side imposes some constraints on $E$, but these will be potential dependent.
The simplest case, for the wave function of a free particle, is where $V=0$.

In that case we have
\begin{align*}
\frac{X''}{X} +\frac{Y''}{Y} +\frac{Z''}{Z} &= - \frac{2 m E}{\hbar^2}
\end{align*}

The sum of each of the terms involved all identically equal a constant, which is perhaps
reasonable to assume to be negative.  If we do so and impose the usual sort of separation of
variables constrait, requiring each of the $X''/X$, $Y''/Y$, and $Z''/Z$ terms to separately
equal some negative constant (to be fixed by boundary conditions), we can write

\begin{align*}
\frac{X''}{X} &= -{k_1}^2 \\
\frac{Y''}{Y} &= -{k_2}^2 \\
\frac{Z''}{Z} &= -{k_3}^2 \\
\end{align*}

So we have for the complete equation a solution proportional to

\begin{align*}
\phi = X Y Z T &= \exp(i(\Bk \cdot \Bx - E t/\hbar))
\end{align*}

With the additonal boundary value constraint of
\begin{align*}
\Bk^2 &= \frac{2 m E}{\hbar^2}
\end{align*}

\subsection{ constant potential variation. }

Let's consider a slightly more general potential with $V$ constant in some interval.

By inspection, in the interval we now have as the solution

\begin{align*}
\phi &= \exp(i(\Bk \cdot \Bx - (E - V) t/\hbar)) \\
\Bk^2 &= \frac{2 m (E - V)}{\hbar^2}
\end{align*}

Based on just the math, we don't know that $E$ is neccessarily positive, so in addition to the trigonometric solution above is it also reasonable to
allow for possible
hyperbolic solutions

\begin{align*}
\phi &= \exp(\Bk \cdot \Bx - i(E - V) t/\hbar) \\
\Bk^2 &= \frac{2 m (V - E)}{\hbar^2}
\end{align*}

We need some physics
to augment the math in order to determine what form of solution is actually valid.  Some of that physics likely comes in the form of the boundary conditions and perhaps other constraints such as normalization.

\subsection{ General solution. }

Using superposition we should be able to form a wave packet in integral form
by allowing for any set of $\Bk$ vectors.  Suppose we assemble a test solution by summing over possible wave numbers

\begin{align*}
\phi = \int A(\Bk) \exp(\alpha(\Bk \cdot \Bx) + i(E - V) t/\hbar) dk_1 dk_2 dk_3 \\
\end{align*}

FIXME: time term sign fudged to make the $V$ cancel out.  Must have a mistake above.

Does this work?  Let's take derivatives and see what constraints we require if it does.

\begin{align*}
\grad^2 \phi &= \alpha^2 \Bk^2 \phi \\
i \hbar \partial_t \phi &= -(E - V) \phi
\end{align*}

So we have
\begin{align*}
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \alpha^2 \Bk^2 \phi + V\phi = -(E-V) \phi
\end{align*}

and the constraint required for the wave number $\Bk$ is 

\begin{align*}
\alpha^2 \Bk^2 = \frac{2 m E }{\hbar^2}
\end{align*}

So, for trig solutions (plane waves) where $\alpha \propto i$ our energy integration constant $E$ takes a negative value.
For hyperbolic solutions, where $\alpha = \pm 1$ (say), our energy has a positive value.

This screams for the boundary values of a 3D particle in a box problem, which for infinite potential outside the
box will require sinusoidal solutions (to vanish on the boundaries since the particle can't get past the potential
barrier).

\section{ Problem 2. Probabilities for a polynomial wavefunction. }

\subsection{ normalize it. }

This part can be done directly with a contour integration.

\subsection{ definite integral of probablility. }

While a partial fractions split of the probability density can be done
around the poles $\{\pm\sqrt{i}, \pm i \sqrt{i}\}$

\begin{align*}
\frac{1 + x^2}{1 + x^4} &=
\frac{A}{x -\sqrt{i}}
+\frac{B}{x +\sqrt{i}}
+\frac{C}{x -i\sqrt{i}}
+\frac{D}{x +i\sqrt{i}}
\end{align*}

Integrating these is straight forward (logarithms), but
the algebra gets messy to simplify the resulting expression (perhaps not so
much for the $[0,1]$ interval of the question).

A lazier way is to invoke \href{http://integrals.wolfram.com/index.jsp}{webmathematica}, which gives

\begin{align*}
\int \frac{1 + x^2}{1 + x^4} dx &=
\frac{-\tan^{-1}(1 - \sqrt{2} x) + \tan^{-1}(1 + \sqrt{2} x)}{ \sqrt{2} }
\end{align*}
