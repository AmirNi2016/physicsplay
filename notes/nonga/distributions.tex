\section{ Motivation. }

I recently listened to Prof Brad Osgood's lectures on distributions in Fourier
transform theory and read the associated lecture notes
\cite{osgoodFourier}.  Here is an attempt to apply these ideas to solution
of some of the common PDEs of physics (wave and Poisson equations).

Some of these were tackled recently using ``classical'' Fourier methods
in \cite{PJpoisson}. 
This requires ad-hoc PV associations of integrals with delta and step
functions.  Such solutions do not inspire confidence.  Without
validation of the solutions by substituion back into the generating PDE
or comparison to a known solution one is left wondering
if all the right fudges were actually performed to get the answer.

\section{ Conventions and definitions. }

\subsection{ Transform pairs. }

The form of the Fourier transform pairs used here are
\begin{align*}
\hat{f}(\mathbf{k}) &= \frac{1}{(\sqrt{2\pi})^n} \iiint f(\mathbf{x}) e^{-i \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{x} } d^n x \\
{f}(\mathbf{x}) &= \frac{1}{(\sqrt{2\pi})^n} \iiint \hat{f}(\mathbf{k}) e^{i \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{x} } d^n k \\
\end{align*}

\subsection{ Space of Schwarz functions. }

\section{ 1D first order homogeneous wave equation. }

This is the simplest PDE that I can think of that one should be able 
to apply Fourier techniques to.  We seek solutions $f(x,t)$ of

\begin{align}
\inv{v} \PD{t}{f} - \PD{x}{f} = 0
\end{align}
