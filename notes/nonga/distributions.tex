\section{ Motivation. }

I recently listened to Prof Brad Osgood's lectures on distributions in Fourier
transform theory and read the associated lecture notes
\cite{osgoodFourier}.  Here is an attempt to apply these ideas to solution
of some of the common PDEs of physics (wave and Poisson equations).

Some of these were tackled recently using ``classical'' Fourier methods
in \cite{PJpoisson}. 
This requires ad-hoc PV associations of integrals with delta and step
functions.  Such solutions do not inspire confidence.  Without
validation of the solutions by substituion back into the generating PDE
or comparison to a known solution one is left wondering
if all the right fudges were actually performed to get the answer.

\section{ Conventions and definitions. }

\subsection{ Transform pairs. }

The form of the Fourier transform pairs used here will be

\begin{align*}
\hat{f}(\mathbf{k}) &= \frac{1}{(\sqrt{2\pi})^n} \int f(\mathbf{x}) e^{-i \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{x} } d^n x \\
{f}(\mathbf{x}) &= \frac{1}{(\sqrt{2\pi})^n} \int \hat{f}(\mathbf{k}) e^{i \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{x} } d^n k \\
\end{align*}

\section{ 1D first order homogeneous wave equation. }

This is the simplest PDE that I can think of that one should be able 
to apply Fourier techniques to.  We seek solutions $f(x,t)$ of

\begin{align}\label{eqn:firstOrderAdvancedWave}
\inv{v} \PD{t}{f} - \PD{x}{f} = 0
\end{align}

\subsection{ Setup. }

Taking Fourier transforms of equation \ref{eqn:firstOrderAdvancedWave}, and integration
by parts, we have

\begin{align}
\inv{v} \PD{t}{\hat{f}}(k,t) + (-ik)\hat{f}(k,t) = 0
\end{align}

Our solution in the wave number space is thus
\begin{align}\label{eqn:startingPtFirstOrder}
{\hat{f}}(k,t) = A(k) e^{i k v t} = \hat{f}(k,0) e^{i k v t}
\end{align}

This will be the common starting point for both the classical and the distribution approach below.
It probably ought not to be the starting point for the distribution case since to perform the
integration by parts one has to assume that $f(x,t)$ vanish at $\pm \infty$.
The final solution will be seen to not neccessarily have
such a restriction.  How would one get to this point using the distribution formalism?  There we
shouldn't have this trouble since the function $f$ will be coupled with the Schwartz test function
that vanishes satisfactorily at the boundaries.

\subsection{ Classical way. }

To complete the solution in terms of initial conditions we can inverse Fourier transform
equation \ref{eqn:startingPtFirstOrder}

\begin{align*}
{{f}}(x,t) = \inv{\sqrt{2\pi}} \left( \inv{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int f(x',0) e^{-i k x'} dx' e^{i k v t} \right) e^{ i k x } dk
\end{align*}

Here's where things get fishy.  Reversing the order of integration, and performing
the $k$ integration first we want to ``integrate''

\begin{align*}
I(x,t) = \inv{2\pi} \int e^{ i k ((x-x') + v t) } dk
\end{align*}

This we can fudge by saying taking the principle value integral (symmetric about the origin)

\begin{align*}
I(x,t) &= \lim_{R \rightarrow \infty} \inv{\pi} \frac{\sin( R (x-x' + v t) )}{ (x-x' + vt)}
\end{align*}

this is a nascent form of the delta function:

\begin{align*}
\delta(x) \sim \lim_{R \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\sinc( R x )}{\pi x}
\end{align*}

So we have
\begin{align*}
I(x,t) &= \delta(x - x' + v t) 
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
{{f}}(x,t) 
&= \int f(x',0) \delta(x - x' + v t) dx' \\
&= f(x + v t,0) 
\end{align*}

The first order advanced wave equation is thus solved by any function $g(x + vt)$.  This
is familar from
\cite{french1971vaw} where it was stated (then demonstrated correct) that solutions of the second
order homogenous wave equation in one dimension can be expressed in terms of any functions
$g(x \pm vt)$.

By invoking just the right incantations we can pull the delta function out of the magic hat and 
produce this expected result.
