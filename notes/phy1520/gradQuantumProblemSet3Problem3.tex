Consider an electron confined to the interior of a finite hollow cylinder with its axis being \( \zcap \).
Let the inner and outer
walls of the cylinder be at radial coordinates \( \rho_a \) and \( \rho_b > \rho_a \) respectively.
Let the cylinder have its top and bottom ends at \( z = 0,L \).

\makesubproblem{}{gradQuantum:problemSet3:3a}
Find the eigenstates for a particle confined to this cylinder (ignore normalization), and show that its energies are given by

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:gradQuantumProblemSet3Problem3:20}
E_{l m n} = \frac{\Hbar^2}{2 m } \lr{ k_{m n}^2 + \lr{ \frac{ \pi l }{L} }^2 } \qquad ( l = 1,2,3, \cdots ; m = 0, 1, 2, \cdots )
\end{equation}

where \( k_{m n} \) is the $n$th root of the equation

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:gradQuantumProblemSet3Problem3:40}
J_m (k_{m n} \rho_b ) N_m (k_{m n} \rho_a ) - N_m (k_{m n} \rho_b ) J_m (k_{m n} \rho_a ) = 0.
\end{dmath}

\makesubproblem{}{gradQuantum:problemSet3:3b}
Repeat this problem with a uniform magnetic field \( B \zcap \) which is confined to the region \( 0 < \rho < \rho_a \) (i.e., only in the hollow part of the cylinder). Show that there is a periodicity of the energy levels with the field, with the period
being such that \( \pi \rho_a^2 B = 2 \pi N \hbar/e \).
