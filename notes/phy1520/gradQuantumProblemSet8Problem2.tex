\makeproblem{Quadrupolar potential}{gradQuantum:problemSet8:2}{ 

Consider a p-orbital electron of hydrogen with \( \ket{ n,l = 1, m } \), with \( m = 0, \pm 1 \), subject to an external potential

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:gradQuantumProblemSet8Problem2:20}
V(x, y, z) = \lambda(x^2 - y^2),
\end{dmath}

with \( \lambda \) being a constant. For fixed \( n \), obtain the correct eigenstates which diagonalize
the perturbation, without worrying about doing radial integrals explicitly. Show that the three-fold degeneracy of the
p-orbital is completely broken by the perturbation to linear order in \( \lambda \).
