- revisit rod balancing problem (still in ../blogit).  Perhaps try particle on a table problem first.
- revisit the Sakurai "tricky problem" from chapter 5, discussed in tutorial.
- look for and fix any FIXMEs
- have a strange mix of hats and no-hats throughout.
- \hat{\BL} looks weird. (but \hat{L} looks okay).  Partial fix in peeters_macros.sty, but this could be revisited.  Am not sure I like the widehat use that is left, and may revert it.
- some sections need to be merged to deal with lecture boundary interference.
- Parmekanti to send his notes for merge.
- should zitterbewegung be always capitalized (it would be in German, does that carry over?)
