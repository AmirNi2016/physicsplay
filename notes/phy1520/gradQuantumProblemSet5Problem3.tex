%\makesubproblem{}{gradQuantum:problemSet5:3a}

A quantum state \( \ket{\Psi} \) is a simultaneous eigenstate of two anticommuting Hermitian operators \( A, B \), with \( A B + B A = 0\).
What can you say about the eigenvalues of \( A, B \) for the state \(\ket{\Psi}\)? Illustrate your point using the parity operator and the momentum operator.
