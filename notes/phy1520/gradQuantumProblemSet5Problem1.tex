\makeproblem{No Kramers theorem for spin-1}{gradQuantum:problemSet5:1}{ 
%\makesubproblem{}{gradQuantum:problemSet5:1a}

Consider a spin-1 particle. Even with time-reversal invariance, there is no Kramers theorem, so each eigenvalue of
a generic spin-1 Hamiltonian will be non-degenerate. Systematically construct a Hamiltonian which is time-reversal
invariant and obviously also Hermitian to illustrate this point, making clear the logic of your construction (i.e., why you are including terms which you are including).
