Consider the Helium atom with atomic number \( Z=2 \), which leads to the nuclear charge \( Z=2e \), and two electrons with charge \( -e \) each. Show that ignoring electron-electron interactions leads to a ground state energy \( E_{\textrm{He}} = 4 E_\txtH \)
where \( E_\txtH \) is the ground state energy of the hydrogen atom. 
Consider the full problem which retains the Coulomb interaction between the electrons, i.e.

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:gradQuantumProblemSet7Problem2:20}
H
=
\inv{2m} \lr{ \Bp_1^2 + \Bp_2^2 }
- 
2 e^2
\inv{4 \pi \epsilon_0 }
\lr{ \inv{r_1} + \inv{r_2} }
+ 
e^2
\inv{4 \pi \epsilon_0 }
\inv{ \Abs{\Br_1 - \Br_2} }.
\end{dmath}

and consider the variational wavefunction
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:gradQuantumProblemSet7Problem2:40}
\psi(\Br_1, \Br_2)
=
N
e^{- \inv{a} \lr{ r_1 + r_2 } }.
\end{dmath}

where \( N \) is the normalization constant, and \( a \) is a variational parameter. Determine the variational ground state energy, and minimize with respect to a to find the best estimate for the ground state energy of Helium. 
Compare with numerical estimates of the energy.
