Consider a 1D harmonic oscillator with an unnormalized trial wavefunction \( \psi_v(x) = e^{-\beta \Abs{x}} \).
Minimize the ground state energy with respect to \( \beta \), thus obtaining the optimal \( \beta \) as well as the variational ground state energy. 
Compare with the exact result. 
Note that you need to be careful evaluating derivatives since the wavefunction has a `cusp' at \( x = 0\).
