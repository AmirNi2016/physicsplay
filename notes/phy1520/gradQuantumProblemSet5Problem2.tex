\makeproblem{Boosts}{gradQuantum:problemSet5:2}{ 

The momentum operator \( \hat{p} \) was shown, in class, to act as the generator of space translations. Show by following the exact same steps that the position operator \( \hat{x} \) acts as the generator of momentum boosts (i.e., \( \hat{x} \) is a generator of `momentum translation').
