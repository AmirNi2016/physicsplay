This document is based on my lecture notes for the Fall 2012, University of Toronto Basic Statistical Mechanics course (PHY452H1S), taught by Prof.\ Arun Paramekanti.  

%My thanks to Professor Paramekanti for teaching this course.  He knows his subject well, and I learned a lot.

Official course description:

Classical and quantum statistical mechanics of noninteracting systems; the statistical basis of thermodynamics; ensembles, partition function; thermodynamic equilibrium; stability and fluctuations; formulation of quantum statistics; theory of simple gases; ideal Bose and Fermi systems.

%In the course of the lectures the books \citep{hecht1998hecht}, \citep{fowles1989introduction}, and \citep{born1980principles} are referred to, but none were required texts for the course.

This document will likely contain a few things

\begin{itemize}
\item Plain old lecture notes.   %These mirror what was covered in class.  I've made no attempt to go and incorporate the much more extensive hand written supplementary notes supplied with the lectures.  In some cases I've likely filled in some of the same details that those hand written notes covered when working through my lecture notes trying to make sense of things.

\item Personal notes exploring details that were not clear to me from the lectures, or from the texts associated with the lecture material.

\item Assigned problems.  Like anything else take these as is.  I may or may not have gone back and corrected errors, and I definitely made some.

\item Some worked problems attempted as course prep, for fun, or for exam preparation, or post exam review.

\item Links to Mathematica workbooks (if any) associated with course content or these notes.

\end{itemize}
