This document is based on my lecture notes for the Winter 2013, University of Toronto Basic Statistical Mechanics course (PHY452H1S), taught by Prof.\ Arun Paramekanti.  

%My thanks to Professor Paramekanti for teaching this course.  He knows his subject well, and I learned a lot.

Official course description:

Classical and quantum statistical mechanics of noninteracting systems; the statistical basis of thermodynamics; ensembles, partition function; thermodynamic equilibrium; stability and fluctuations; formulation of quantum statistics; theory of simple gases; ideal Bose and Fermi systems.

This document will likely contain a few things

\begin{itemize}
\item Plain old lecture notes.   These mirror what was covered in class, and do not incorporate any of the supplementary class notes.

\item Personal notes exploring details that were not clear to me from the lectures, or from the texts associated with the lecture material.

\item Assigned problems.  Like anything else take these as is.  I may or may not have gone back and corrected errors.

\item Some worked problems attempted as course prep, for fun, or for test preparation, or post test reflection.

\item Links to Mathematica workbooks associated with these notes.

\end{itemize}
