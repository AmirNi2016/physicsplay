- a number of older notes compilations could be switched to \makeproblem/makeanswer format for solved problems.  Especially:
   phy356

- files copied with ORIG_FILES and ORIG_FRONTBACK_FILES don't have the right dependencies.  to update any of these have to make clean ; make (same issue with ../phy454/ (and many of the other makefiles that have ORIG_FILES rules)).
