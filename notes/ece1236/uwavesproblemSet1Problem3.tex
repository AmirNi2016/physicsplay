\makeproblem{Lossless transmission line with load.}{uwaves:problemSet1:3}{ 

A lossless transmission line of characteristic impedance \( Z_0 = 75 \Omega \) is terminated to an
unknown complex impedance \( Z_\txtL \).  The transmission line is filled with air. The first
voltage maximum is measured at a distance \( d = 9.7 \si{mm} \) from the load and the voltage
standing-wave ratio on the line is measured to be \( \textrm{VSWR} = 2.33 \). The operating frequency
is \( f = 3.0 \si{GHz} \).

\makesubproblem{}{uwaves:problemSet1:3a}

Determine the location of the first current minimum.

\makesubproblem{}{uwaves:problemSet1:3b}

What is the magnitude (amplitude) of the reflection coefficient \( \Abs{ \Gamma_\txtL } \).

\makesubproblem{}{uwaves:problemSet1:3c}

What is the phase of the reflection coefficient \( \Theta_\txtL \)?

\makesubproblem{}{uwaves:problemSet1:3d}

Determine the load \( Z_\txtL \).
