%\makesubproblem{}{uwaves:problemSet1:2a}
A transmission line is filled with a non-magnetic dielectric of \( \epsilon_r = 2.5\). The line has a capacitance per unit length of \( C = 200 \si{pF/m}\) and a resistance per unit length of \( R = 2 \Omega/\si{m} \).
Calculate the corresponding phase velocity, characteristic impedance and attenuation constant \( \alpha \) (assume \(G = 0\)).
