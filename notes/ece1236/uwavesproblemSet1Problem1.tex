\makeproblem{Transmission line basics.}{uwaves:problemSet1:1}{ 

A two-wire line has distributed parameters \( L' = 6.5 \mu \si{ H/m} \) and \( C' = 8.7 \si{pF/m} \).

\makesubproblem{}{uwaves:problemSet1:1a}
What is the characteristic impedance (resistance) of the line?

\makesubproblem{}{uwaves:problemSet1:1b}
What is the phase velocity this transmission line?

\makesubproblem{}{uwaves:problemSet1:1c}

If a voltage wave with time waveform \( V^{-}(t)\) is traveling along the line in the \( -z\) direction, and has an amplitude of \( 10 \si{V} \), write a time-domain expression for the current wave associated with this voltage wave, using numerical parameters determined in 
\partref{uwaves:problemSet1:1a} and 
\partref{uwaves:problemSet1:1b}.
