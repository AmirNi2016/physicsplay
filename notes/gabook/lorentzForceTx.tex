\section{ Motivation. }

Reading of \cite{bohm1996str} is a treatment of the Lorentz transform
properties of the Lorentz force equation.  This isn't clear to me
without working through it myself, but in doing so I have the urge to
try it with the GA formulation of the Lorentz transformation.

\section{ GA Lorentz tx. }

I've got the coordinate and Geometric Algebra versions of the Lorentz
transform all mixed up in my head.  Let's work through the relations 
between these once more.

Write the Lorentz boost of a four vector $x = x^\mu \gamma_\mu = ct \gamma_0 + x^k \gamma_k$ as

\begin{align}\label{eqn:LorentzBoost}
L(x) &= 
e^{-\alpha \vcap/2}
x
e^{\alpha \vcap/2}
\end{align}

\subsection{ Invariance property. }

A Lorentz transformation (boost or rotation) can be defined as those transformation that leave the four vector square unchanged.

Following \cite{doran2003gap}, work with a $+---$ metric signature ($1 = \gamma_0^2 = -\gamma_k^2$), and $\sigma_k = \gamma_k \gamma_0$.  Our four vector square in this representation has the familiar invariant form

\begin{align*}
x^2 
&= (ct \gamma_0 + x^m \gamma_m) (ct \gamma_0 + x^k \gamma_k) \\
&= (ct \gamma_0 + x^m \gamma_m) \gamma_0^2 (ct \gamma_0 + x^k \gamma_k) \\
&= (ct + x^m \sigma_m) (ct - x^k \sigma_k) \\
&= (ct + \Bx) (ct - \Bx) \\
&= (ct)^2 - \Bx^2
\end{align*}

and we expect this of the Lorentz boost of equation \ref{eqn:LorentzBoost}.  To verify we have

\begin{align*}
L(x)^2 
&=
e^{-\alpha \vcap/2}
x
e^{\alpha \vcap/2}
e^{-\alpha \vcap/2}
x
e^{\alpha \vcap/2} \\
&=
e^{-\alpha \vcap/2}
x
x
e^{\alpha \vcap/2} \\
&=
x^2
e^{-\alpha \vcap/2}
e^{\alpha \vcap/2} \\
&=
x^2
\end{align*}

\subsection{ Sign of the rapidity angle. }

The factor $\alpha$ will be the rapidity angle, but what sign do we want for a boost along the positive $\vcap$ direction?

Dropping to coordinates is an easy way to determine the sign convention in effect.  Write $\vcap = \sigma_1$

\begin{align*}
L(x) &= 
e^{-\alpha \vcap/2}
x
e^{\alpha \vcap/2} \\
&=
(\cosh(\alpha/2) - \sigma_1 \sinh(\alpha/2))
(
x^0 \gamma_0
+x^1 \gamma_1
+x^2 \gamma_2
+x^3 \gamma_3
)
(\cosh(\alpha/2) + \sigma_1 \sinh(\alpha/2))
\end{align*}

$\sigma_1$ commutes with $\gamma_2$ and $\gamma_3$ and anticommutes otherwise, so we have

\begin{align*}
L(x) &= 
(
x^2 \gamma_2
+x^3 \gamma_3
) 
e^{-\alpha \vcap/2}
e^{\alpha \vcap/2}
+
(
x^0 \gamma_0
+x^1 \gamma_1
)
e^{\alpha \vcap} \\
&=
x^2 \gamma_2
+x^3 \gamma_3
+(
x^0 \gamma_0
+x^1 \gamma_1
)
e^{\alpha \vcap} \\
&=
x^2 \gamma_2
+x^3 \gamma_3
+(
x^0 \gamma_0
+x^1 \gamma_1
)
(\cosh(\alpha) + \sigma_1 \sinh(\alpha))
\end{align*}

Expanding out just the $0,1$ terms changed by the transformation we have

\begin{align*}
(
&x^0 \gamma_0
+x^1 \gamma_1
)
(\cosh(\alpha) + \sigma_1 \sinh(\alpha)) \\
&=
x^0 \gamma_0 \cosh(\alpha) 
+x^1 \gamma_1 \cosh(\alpha) 
+x^0 \gamma_0 \sigma_1 \sinh(\alpha)
+x^1 \gamma_1 \sigma_1 \sinh(\alpha) \\
&=
x^0 \gamma_0 \cosh(\alpha) 
+x^1 \gamma_1 \cosh(\alpha) 
+x^0 \gamma_0 \gamma_1 \gamma_0 \sinh(\alpha)
+x^1 \gamma_1 \gamma_1 \gamma_0 \sinh(\alpha) \\
&=
x^0 \gamma_0 \cosh(\alpha) 
+x^1 \gamma_1 \cosh(\alpha) 
-x^0 \gamma_1 \sinh(\alpha)
-x^1 \gamma_0 \sinh(\alpha) \\
&=
\gamma_0 (x^0 \cosh(\alpha) -x^1 \sinh(\alpha) )
+\gamma_1 (x^1 \cosh(\alpha) -x^0 \sinh(\alpha) )
\\
\end{align*}

Writing ${x^\mu}' = L(x) \cdot \gamma^\mu$, and $x^\mu = x \cdot \gamma^\mu$,
and a substitution of $\cosh(\alpha) = 1/\sqrt{1 - \Bv^2/c^2}$, and $\alpha \vcap = \tanh^{-1}(\Bv/c)$,
we have the traditional coordinate
expression for the one directional Lorentz boost

\begin{align}
\begin{bmatrix}
{x^0}' \\
{x^1}' \\
{x^2}' \\
{x^3}'
\end{bmatrix}
&=
\begin{bmatrix}
\cosh\alpha & -\sinh\alpha & 0 & 0 \\
-\sinh\alpha & \cosh\alpha & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
x^0 \\
x^1 \\
x^2 \\
x^3
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}

Performing this expansion showed initially showed that I had the wrong sign for $\alpha$ in the exponentials and I went back and
adjusted it all accordingly.

\subsection{ Expanding out the Lorentz boost for projective and rejective directions. }

Our position four vector can be decomposed into components that commute and anticommute with the spatial boost direction
$\vcap$.  Write

\begin{align*}
x &= x_\parallel + x_\perp \\
x_\perp \vcap &= \vcap x_\perp \\
x_\parallel \vcap &= -\vcap x_\parallel
\end{align*}

This then allows for a similar, but more general expansion of the coordinate expansion above.  Following the same arguments
as above we have

\begin{align*}
L(x) 
&= x_\perp + x_\parallel e^{\alpha \vcap} \\
&= x_\perp + x_\parallel (\cosh\alpha + \vcap\sinh\alpha) \\
\end{align*}

To procede further a decomposition of $x_\parallel$ is required.  Introducing a four vector with only spatial components for
convienence

\begin{align}
u = \vcap \gamma_0 = - \gamma_0 \vcap
\end{align}

we can compute projective and rejective parts of $x_\parallel$.  This is

\begin{align*}
x_\parallel 
&= x_\parallel u \inv{u} \\
&= (x_\parallel u ) \inv{u} \\
&= (x_\parallel \cdot u + x_\parallel \wedge u) \inv{u} \\
\end{align*}

This is
\begin{align}
x_\parallel &= \underbrace{(x_\parallel \cdot u) \inv{u}}_{\text{spatial four vector components}} + \underbrace{(x_\parallel \wedge u) \cdot \inv{u} }_{\text{timelike component only.}}
\end{align}

As no time components contribute to the first term we can identify $(x_\parallel \cdot u)/u$ with the spatial component of $x_\parallel$ in the direction of $\vcap \gamma_0$.  Similarily $(x_\parallel\wedge u)/u$ should have only the timelike components of $x_\parallel$ with respect to $\gamma_0$.

Some mathematical followup to justify the intuitive description above will be required.  In addition we will want to show that $x_\perp$ has no timelike component ($x_\perp \cdot \gamma_0 = 0$), and that $x_\perp$ also has no components in the direction $\vcap \gamma_0$ ($x_\perp \cdot (\vcap\gamma_0) = 0$).
Let's come back to that afterwards.  For now we can do a preliminary expansion of the boosted vector in terms of this 
projective and rejective split

\begin{align*}
L(x)
&= x_\perp + \left(
\frac{x_\parallel \cdot u}{u} + \left(x_\parallel \wedge u\right) \inv{u} 
\right)\left(\cosh\alpha + u \gamma_0 \sinh\alpha\right) \\
&= x_\perp \\
&+ \left(x_\parallel \wedge u\right) \inv{u} \cosh\alpha 
+ \left(x_\parallel \cdot u\right) \gamma_0 \sinh\alpha \\
&+ \frac{x_\parallel \cdot u}{u} \cosh\alpha 
+ \left(x_\parallel \wedge u\right) \gamma_0 \sinh\alpha
\end{align*}

Here a grouping into pairs of timelike and spacelike components has been used.

Next it is desirable to express the $x_\parallel \cdot u$, and $x_\parallel \wedge u$ products in terms of $\vcap$, and $\gamma_0$ explicitly.
