\section{ Motivation. }

We have observed that the wave equation is Lorentz invarient, and conversely that invarience of the form of the wave equation under linear transformation for light can be used to calculate the Lorentz transformation.  Specifically, this means that we require the equations of light (wave equation) retain its form after a change of variables that includes
a (possibly scaled) translation.  The wave equation should have no mixed partial terms, and retain the form:

\begin{equation*}
(\spacegrad^2 - \partial_{ct}^2) F = ({\spacegrad'}^2 - \partial_{ct'}^2) F = 0
\end{equation*}

Having expressed the spacetime gradient with a (STA) Minkowski basis, and knowing that the Maxwell equation written using the spacetime gradient is Lorentz invarient:

\begin{equation*}
\grad F = J,
\end{equation*}

we therefore expect that the square root of the wave equation (Laplacian) operator is also Lorentz invarient.  Here this idea is explored, and we look at how the spacetime
gradient behaves under Lorentz transformation.

Our spacetime gradient is

\begin{equation*}
\grad = \sum \gamma^{\mu} \frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\mu}}
\end{equation*}

Under Lorentz transformation we can transform the $x^1=x$, and $x^0 = ct$ coordinates:

\begin{equation*}
\begin{bmatrix}
x' \\
ct' \\
\end{bmatrix}
=
\gamma
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -\beta \\
-\beta & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
x \\
ct \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
