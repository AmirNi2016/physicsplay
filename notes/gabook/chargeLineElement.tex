\section{Motivation}

In \cite{purcell1963eam} the electric field for an infinite length charged line element is derived in two ways.  First using summation directly, then with Guass's law.  Associated with the first was the statement that the field must be radial by symmetry.  This was not obvious to me when initially taking my E\&M course, so I thought it was worth revisiting.

\section{ Calculation of electric field for non-infinite length line element. }

\end{figure}

This calculation will be done with a thickness neglected wire running up and down along the $y$ axis as illustrated 
in figure \ref{fig:chargeLineElement}, where the field is being measured at $P = r \Be_1$, and the field contributions
due to all charge elements $dq = \lambda dy$ are to be summed.

We want to sum each of the field contributions along the line, so with

\begin{align*}
d\BE &= \frac{dq \ucap(\theta)}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 R^2} \\
r/R &= \cos\theta \\
dy &= r d(\tan\theta) = r \sec^2 \theta \\
-\ucap(\theta) &= -\Be_1 e^{-i \theta} \\
i &= \Be_1 \Be_2 
\end{align*}

Putting things together we have

\begin{align*}
d\BE
&= \frac{\lambda r \sec^2 \theta \Be_1 e^{-i\theta} d\theta}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r^2 \sec^2 \theta} \\
&= \frac{\lambda \Be_1 e^{-i\theta} d\theta}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r} \\
&= \frac{\lambda \Be_1 i d(e^{-i\theta})}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r} \\
\end{align*}

Thus the total field is
\begin{align*}
\BE
&= \int d\BE \\
&= \frac{\lambda \Be_2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r} \int d(e^{-i\theta}) \\
\end{align*}

We see that the integration, which has the value

\begin{align}
\BE = \frac{\lambda} {4 \pi \epsilon_0 r} \Be_2 e^{-i\delta\theta}
\end{align}

is not really any harder for a non-infinite line element than it is for an infinite one.  If we want the field
contribution for a finite length wire we have only to pick an angle parameterized integration range

\begin{align*}
%[y_1, y_2] = r[\tan\theta_1, \tan\theta_2].
[\theta_1, \theta_2] = [\tan^{-1}(y_1/r), \tan^{-1}(y_2/r)]
\end{align*}

Invoking symmetry was done in order to work with coordinates, but working with the vector quantities directly
avoids this requirement and gives the general result for any subset of angles.

For the specific case of an infinite length wire, one has an integration range of $\theta \in [-\pi/2, \pi/2]$, and
the field at $P$ is thus

%FIXME: messed up signs here?
