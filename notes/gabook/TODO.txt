Okay, that's probably the last I have posted.  The best indication of version is actually the "The last commit" string on the 'Document Version" page (which also has a date).  I should get rid of the manual date and numeric versions to avoid confusion.

... fix up this version and incorrect date business.  Use the commit date everywhere I have a date.

- 
   manual use of : \langle \rangle -> \gpgradezero
   manual use of \left( ... \right) -> \lr{}

- chapters should be flattened.

- Were some TODO's initially Changelog ... anything there still relavant?

- Stokes content split out into a chapter to be rewritten.

- three digit chapter numbers overflow.
