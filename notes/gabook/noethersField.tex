\section{ Derivation. }

It was seen in 
%euler_lagrange.ltx
\cite{PJEulerLagrange} 
that Noether's law for a line integral action was shown
to essentially be an application of the chain rule, coupled with
an application of the Euler-Lagrange equations.

For a field Lagrangian a similar conservation statement can be made, where
it takes the form of a divergence relationship instead of derivative
with respect to the integration parameter associated with the line integral.

Consideration of a Lagrangian with a single field variable

\begin{align*}
\LL &= \LL(\psi, \partial_\mu \psi),
\end{align*}

is actually sufficent to see how this works.  Consider the following transformation:

\begin{align*}
\psi &\rightarrow f(\psi, \alpha) = \psi' \\
\LL' &= \LL(f, \partial_\mu f).
\end{align*}

Taking derivatives of the transformed Lagrangian with respect to the free transformation variable $\alpha$, we have

\begin{align}\label{eqn:noetherschain}
\frac{d\LL'}{d\alpha}
&= \PD{f}{\LL}\PD{\alpha}{f} + \sum_\mu \PD{(\partial_\mu f)}{\LL}\PD{\alpha}{(\partial_\mu f)}
\end{align}

The Euler-Lagrange field equations for the transformed Lagrangian are

\begin{align*}
\PD{f}{\LL} = \sum_\mu \partial_\mu \PD{(\partial_\mu f)}{\LL}.
\end{align*}

For some 
for background discussion, examples, and derivation of the field form of Noether's equation see
%field_lagragian.ltx
\cite{PJFieldLagrangian}.

Now substitute back into \ref{eqn:noetherschain} for

\begin{align*}
\frac{d\LL'}{d\alpha}
&= 
\sum_\mu \left( \partial_\mu \PD{(\partial_\mu f)}{\LL}\right)
\PD{\alpha}{f} + \sum_\mu \PD{(\partial_\mu f)}{\LL}\PD{\alpha}{(\partial_\mu f)} \\
&= 
\sum_\mu \left( \partial_\mu \PD{(\partial_\mu f)}{\LL} \right)
\PD{\alpha}{f} + \sum_\mu \PD{(\partial_\mu f)}{\LL} \partial_\mu \PD{\alpha}{f} \\
\end{align*}

Using the product rule we have
\begin{align*}
\frac{d\LL'}{d\alpha}
&= \sum_\mu \partial_\mu \left( \PD{(\partial_\mu f)}{\LL} \PD{\alpha}{f} \right) \\
&= \sum_\mu \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \cdot \left( \gamma_\mu \PD{(\partial_\mu f)}{\LL} \PD{\alpha}{f} \right) \\
&= \grad \cdot \left( \gamma_\mu \PD{(\partial_\mu \psi')}{\LL} \PD{\alpha}{\psi'} \right) \\
\end{align*}

Here the field doesn't have to be a relativistic field which could be implied by the use of the standard
symbols for relativistic four vector
basis $\{\gamma_\mu\}$ of STA.
This is really a statement that one can form a gradient in the field variable configuration space
using any appropriate reciprocal basis pair.

Noether's law for a field Lagrangian is a statement that if the transformed Lagrangian is unchanged (invariant) by
some type of parameterized field variable transformation, then with $J' = {J'}^\mu \gamma_\mu$ one has

\begin{align}
\frac{\LL'}{d\alpha} &= \grad \cdot J' = 0 \\
{J'}^\mu &= \PD{(\partial_\mu \psi')}{\LL} \PD{\alpha}{\psi'} 
\end{align}

\section{ Examples. }

\subsection{ Schrodenger invariance under phase change. }

The relativistic Schrodenger Lagrangian

\begin{align*}
\LL = \eta^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu \psi \partial_\nu \psi^\conj + m^2 \psi \psi^\conj,
\end{align*}

gives a simple example application of the field form of Noether's equation, for a 
transformation that involves a phase change

\begin{align*}
\psi &\rightarrow \psi' = e^{i\theta}\psi \\
\psi^\conj &\rightarrow {\psi^\conj}' = e^{-i\theta}\psi^\conj.
\end{align*}

This transformation leaves the Lagrangian unchanged, so there is an associated conserved
quantity.

\begin{align*}
%\PD{\psi'}{\LL} &= m^2 {\psi'}^\conj \\
\PD{\theta}{\psi'} &= i \psi' \\
\PD{(\partial_\mu \psi')}{\LL} &= \eta^{\mu\nu}\partial_\nu {\psi'}^\conj = \partial^\mu {\psi'}^\conj 
\end{align*}

Summing all the field partials, treating $\psi$, and $\psi^\conj$ as separate
field variables the divergence conservation statement is
\begin{align*}
\partial_\mu \left(
\underbrace{
\partial^\mu {\psi'}^\conj i\psi'
-\partial^\mu {\psi'} i{\psi'}^\conj
}_{{J'}^\mu}
\right) = 0
\end{align*}

Dropping primes and writing $J = \gamma_\mu J^\mu$, this is

\begin{align*}
J &= i (\psi \grad {\psi}^\conj - \psi^\conj \grad {\psi} ) \\
\grad \cdot J &= 0
\end{align*}

Apparently with charge added this quantity actually represents electric current density.  It will be interesting to
learn some quantum mechanics and see how this works.
