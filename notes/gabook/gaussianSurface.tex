In \cite{purcell1963eam}, section $1.10$ is a demonstration that the flux
through any closed surface is the same as that through a sphere.
A nice demonstration of the same is possible using a spherical polar basis
$\{\rcap, \phicap, \thetacap\}$ with an element of surface area that is
tilted slightly as illustrated in figure \ref{fig:surface_flux_element}.
