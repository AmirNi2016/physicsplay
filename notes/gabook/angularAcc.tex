A more coherent derivation of angular velocity and acceleration than
my initial attempt while first learning geometric algebra.

\section{ Angular velocity. }

The goal is to take first and second derivatives of a vector expressed
radially:

\[
\Br = r \rcap.
\]

First step is to expand the velocity in terms of radial components,
projecting onto the radial and perpendicular directions respectively:

\[
\Br' = \Bv = \rcap \rcap \Bv = \rcap \left(\rcap \cdot \Bv\right) + \rcap \left(\rcap \wedge \Bv\right)
\]

That first projective term can be rewritten in terms of magnitude:

\[
\left(r^2\right)' = 2 r r' = \left(\Br \cdot \Br\right)' = 2 \Br \cdot \Bv.
\]

Thus

\[
\rcap \cdot \Bv = r'.
\]

That plus the introduction of an angular velocity bivector

\[
\BOmega = \frac{\Br \wedge \Bv}{r^2}
\]

Allows for the final radial expression of the velocity:

\[
\Bv = \rcap r' + \Br \BOmega.
\]

Using a bivector for the angular velocity is different than the traditional
use of a vector that is normal to the plane.

This bivector encodes the
angular velocity as a plane directly.  The
product of a vector with the bivector that contains it produces another vector
in the plane.  That product is a scaled and rotated by 90 degrees, much like the
multiplication by a unit complex imaginary.  That is no coincidence since
the square of a bivector is negative and directly encodes this complex structure
of an arbitarily oriented plane.

\section{ Angular acceleration. }

Next we take second derivatives:

\[
\Bv' = \Ba = \left(\rcap r' + \frac{\Br}{r^2} \left(\Br \wedge \Bv\right)\right)'
\]

%\rcap' = \inv{r^3} \Br \Br \wedge \Bv
\begin{align*}
\Ba
&= \rcap' r' + \rcap r'' + \frac{\Br}{r^2} \underbrace{\left(\Bv \wedge \Bv\right)}_{=0} + \frac{\Br}{r^2} \left(\Br \wedge \Ba\right) + \left(\frac{\rcap}{r}\right)' \left(\Br \wedge \Bv\right) \\
&=
\rcap r''
+\rcap'\left( r'  + \frac{1}{r} \Br \wedge \Bv \right)
- r' \frac{\rcap}{r^2} \left(\Br \wedge \Bv\right)
+ \rcap \left(\rcap \wedge \Ba\right)  \\
&=
\rcap r''
+\inv{r^3} \Br\left( \Br \wedge \Bv\right) \left( r'  + \frac{1}{r} \Br \wedge \Bv \right)
- r' \frac{\rcap}{r^2} \left(\Br \wedge \Bv\right)
+ \rcap \left(\rcap \wedge \Ba\right)  \\
\end{align*}

The $r'$ terms cancel out, leaving just:

\[
\Ba = \rcap r'' + \Br \BOmega^2 +
\rcap \left(\rcap \wedge \Ba\right)
\]

The squared bivector $\BOmega^2$ is a negative scalar, thus the first two terms are radially directed.  The last is perpendicular to the accelaration, in the plane formed
by the vector and its second derivative.

Given the acceleration, the force on a particle is thus:

\[
\BF = m\Ba = m\rcap r'' + m \Br \BOmega^2 + \frac{\Br}{r^2} \left(\Br \wedge \Bp\right)'
\]

Writing the angular momentum as:

\[
\BL = \Br \wedge \Bp = m r^2 \BOmega
\]

the force is thus:

\[
\BF = m\Ba = m\rcap r'' + m \Br \BOmega^2 + \frac{1}{\Br} \frac{d\BL}{dt}
\]

The derivative of the angular momentum is called the torque $\Btau$, also a bivector:

\[
\Btau = \frac{d\BL}{dt}
\]

When $\Br$ is constant this has the radial arm times force form that we expect of torque:

\[
\Btau = \Br \wedge \frac{d \Bp}{dt} = \Br \wedge \BF
\]

As with all these plane quantities (angular velocity, momentum, acceleration), the torque as well is a bivector as it is natural to express this as a planar quantity.  This makes
more sense in many ways than a cross product, since all of these quantities should be perfectly well defined in a plane (or in spaces of degree greater than three), whereas the
cross product is a strictly three dimensional entity.
