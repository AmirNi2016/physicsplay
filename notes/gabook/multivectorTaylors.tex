\section{ Motivation. }

The book \cite{doran2003gap} uses Geometric Calculus heavily in its 
Lagrangian treament.  In particular it is used in some incomprehensible seeming ways in the 
stress energy tensor treatment.

In the treatment of transformation of the dependent variables (not the field
variables themselves) of field Lagrangians, there is one bit that
appears to be the first order linear term from a multivariable taylor
series expansion.  Play with multivariable taylor series here a bit
to develop some intuition with it.

\section{ Single variable case, and generalization of it. }

For the single variable case, Taylor series takes the form

\begin{align}
f(x) = \sum \frac{x^k}{k!} \left. \frac{d^k f(x)}{dx^k} \right\vert_{x=0}
\end{align}

or
\begin{align}
f(x_0 + \epsilon) = \sum \frac{\epsilon^k}{k!} \left. \frac{d^k f(x)}{dx^k} \right\vert_{x=x_0}
\end{align}

As pointed out in \cite{byron1992mca}, this can (as they demonstrated for polynomials) be put into exponential 
operator form

\begin{align}
f(x_0 + \epsilon) = \left. e^{\epsilon d/dx} f(x) \right\vert_{x=x_0}
\end{align}

Without proof, the multivector generalization of this is

\begin{align}
f(x_0 + \epsilon) 
&= \left. e^{\epsilon \cdot \grad} f(x) \right\vert_{x=x_0} \\
&= \sum \inv{k!} \left. {(\epsilon \cdot \grad)^k} f(x) \right\vert_{x=x_0}
\end{align}

Let's work with this, and develop some comfort with what it means, then revisit the proof.

\section{ Directional Derivatives. }

First a definition of directional derivative is required.

In 
\href{http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcIII/DirectionalDeriv.aspx}{standard two variable vector calculus} the directional derivative is defined in one of the following ways
\begin{align}
\spacegrad_\Bu f(x,y) &= \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x + a h, y + b h) - f(x,y)}{h} \\
\Bu &= (a,b)
\end{align}

Or \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directional_derivative}{in a more general vector form} as 

\begin{align}
\spacegrad_\Bu f(\Bx) &= \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(\Bx + h\Bu) - f(\Bx)}{h}
\end{align}

Or \href{http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DirectionalDerivative.html}{in terms of the gradient} as 
\begin{align}
\spacegrad_\Bu f(\Bx) &= \frac{\Bu}{\Abs{\Bu}} \cdot \spacegrad f
\end{align}

Each of these was for a vector parameterized scalar function.
