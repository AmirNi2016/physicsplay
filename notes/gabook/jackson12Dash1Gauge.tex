%\section{Motivation}

At the end of section 12.1 in Jackson \cite{jackson1975cew} he states that it is obvious that the Lorentz force equations are gauge invarient.

\begin{align}\label{eqn:jacksonGaugeInv:foo1}
\frac{d \Bp}{dt} &= e \left( \BE + \frac{\Bu}{c} \cross \BB \right) \\
\frac{d E}{dt} &= e \Bu \cdot \BE 
\end{align}

Well, what's obvious to Jackson here wasn't to me.  After a bit of puzzling I can see why and can perhaps say it is now obvious.

Looking ahead to one of the problems on Gauge
