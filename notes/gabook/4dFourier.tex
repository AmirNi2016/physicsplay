\section{ Motivation. }

In \cite{PJfirstOrderMaxwell}, a solution of the first order Maxwell equation

\begin{align}
\grad F &= \frac{J }{\epsilon_0 c}
\end{align}

was found to be

\begin{align}
F(\Bx,t) 
&=
\inv{({2\pi})^3} \int 
e^{-i c \Bk t}
\left(
F(\Bu, 0) + \inv{\epsilon_0} \int_{\tau = -\infty}^{t} e^{i c \Bk \tau } \gamma_0 J(\Bu,\tau)  d\tau  
\right)
e^{i \Bk \cdot (\Bx-\Bu)} 
d^3 u
d^3 k
\end{align}

This doesn't have the spacetime uniformity that is expected for a solution of a Lorentz invariant equation.

Similarily, in \cite{PJfourierMaxwellSecondOrder} solutions of the second order Maxwell equation in the Lorentz gauge
$\grad \cdot A = 0$ 

\begin{align*}
F &= \grad \wedge A \\
\grad^2 A &= J/\epsilon_0 c
\end{align*}

were found to be
\begin{align}\label{eqn:fourVectorPotentials}
{A^\mu}(x)
&= \inv{\epsilon_0 c} \int J^\mu(x') G(x - x') d^4 x' \\
G(x)
&= 
\frac{u(x \cdot \gamma_0)}{ (2\pi)^3 }
\int
\sin( \Abs{\Bk} x \cdot \gamma_0 )
\exp\left( -i (\Bk \gamma_0) \cdot x \right)
\frac{d^3 k}{ \Abs{\Bk} }
\end{align}

Here our convolution kernel $G$ also doesn't exhibit a uniform four vector form that one could logically expect.

In these notes an attempt to rework these problems using a 4D spacetime Fourier transform will be made.

\section{ 4D Fourier transform. }

As before we want a multivector friendly Fourier transform pair, and choose the following

\begin{align}\label{eqn:FourierTxDefinition}
\hat{\psi}(x) &= \inv{(\sqrt{2\pi})^4} \IIinf \psi(x) \exp\left( -i k \cdot x \right) d^4 x \\
{\psi}(k) &= \PV \inv{(\sqrt{2\pi})^4} \IIinf \hat{\psi}(k) \exp\left( i k \cdot x \right) d^4 k
\end{align}

Here we use $i = \gamma_0 \gamma_1 \gamma_2 \gamma_3$ as our pseudoscalar, and have to therefore be careful of order
of operations since this does not neccessarily commute with multivector $\psi$ or $\hat{\psi}$ functions.

For our dot product and vectors, with summation over matched upstairs downstairs indexes implied, we write

\begin{align*}
x &= x^\mu \gamma_\mu = x_\mu \gamma^\mu \\
k &= k^\mu \gamma_\mu = k_\mu \gamma^\mu \\
x \cdot k &= x^\mu k_\mu = x_\mu k^\mu
\end{align*}

Finally our differential volume elements are defined to be

\begin{align*}
d^4 x &= dx^0 dx^1 dx^2 dx^3 \\
d^4 k &= dk_0 dk_1 dk_2 dk_3 \\
\end{align*}

Note the opposite pairing of upstairs and downstairs indexes in the coordinates.

\section{ Potential equations. }

First for the attack is the Maxwell potential equations.  As well as using a 4D transform, having learned how to do Fourier
transformations of multivectors, we will attack this one in vector form as well.  Our equation to invert is

\begin{align*}
\grad^2 A = J/\epsilon_0 c
\end{align*}

There is nothing special to do for the transformation of the current term, but the left hand side will require two integration
parts

\begin{align*}
\FF(\grad^2 A )
&= \inv{(2 \pi)^2} \IIinf \left(\left(\partial_{00} - \sum_m \partial_{mm}\right) A \right) e^{ -i k_\mu x^\mu } d^4 x \\
&= \inv{(2 \pi)^2} \IIinf A \left( (-i k_0)^2 - \sum_m (-i k_m)^2 \right) e^{ -i k_\mu x^\mu } d^4 x \\
\end{align*}

As usual it is required that $A$ and $\partial_\mu A$ vanish at infinity.  Now for the scalar in the interior we have

\begin{align*}
(-i k_0)^2 - \sum_m (-i k_m)^2 
&= -(k_0)^2 + \sum_m (k_m)^2 \\
\end{align*}

But this is just the (negation) of the square of our wave number vector
\begin{align*}
k^2 
&= k_\mu \gamma^\mu \cdot k_\nu \gamma^\nu \\
&= k_\mu k_\nu \gamma^\mu \cdot \gamma^\nu \\
&= 
k_0 k_0 \gamma_0 \cdot \gamma^0 
-\sum_{a,b} k_a k_b \gamma_a \cdot \gamma^b \\
&= (k_0)^2 - \sum_a (k_a)^2
\end{align*}

Putting things back together we have for our potential vector in the wave number domain

\begin{align*}
\hat{A} &= \frac{\hat{J}}{- k^2 \epsilon_0 c}
\end{align*}

Inverting, and substitution for $\hat{J}$ gives us our spacetime domain potential vector in one fell swoop

\begin{align*}
A(x)
&= 
\inv{(\sqrt{2\pi})^4} \IIinf 
\left(
\inv{- k^2 \epsilon_0 c} \inv{(\sqrt{2\pi})^4} \IIinf {J}(x') e^{-i k \cdot x' } d^4 x'
\right)
e^{ i k \cdot x } d^4 k \\
&= 
\inv{({2\pi})^4} \IIinf {J}(x') \inv{- k^2 \epsilon_0 c} e^{ i k \cdot (x - x') } d^4 k d^4 x'
\\
\end{align*}

This allows us to write this entire specific solution to the forced wave equation problem as a convolution integral

\begin{align}
A(x) &= \inv{\epsilon_0 c} \IIinf {J}(x') G(x-x') d^4 x' \\
G(x) &= \frac{-1}{ ({2\pi})^4} \IIinf \frac{e^{ i k \cdot x }}{ k^2 } d^4 k 
\end{align}

Slick!

\subsection{ The homogeneous case. }

The missing element here is the addition of any allowed homogeneous solutions to the wave equation.
The form of such solutions cannot be obtained with the 4D transform since that produces

\begin{align*}
-k^2 \hat{A} = 0
\end{align*}

and no meaningful inversion of that is possible.

For the homogeneous problem we are forced to reexpress the spacetime Laplacian with an explicit bias towards either time or a specific direction in space, and attack with a Fourier transform on the remaining coordinates.  This has been done previously, but we can
revisit this using our new vector transform.

Now we switch to a spatial Fourier transform

\begin{align}\label{eqn:3DFourierTxDefinition}
\hat{\psi}(\Bk, t) &= \inv{(\sqrt{2\pi})^3} \IIinf \psi(\Bx, t) \exp\left( -i \Bk \cdot \Bx \right) d^3 x \\
{\psi}(\Bx, t) &= \PV \inv{(\sqrt{2\pi})^3} \IIinf \hat{\psi}(\Bk, t) \exp\left( i \Bk \cdot \Bx \right) d^3 k
\end{align}

Using a spatial transform we have

\begin{align*}
\FF((\partial_{00} - \sum_m \partial_{mm}) A)
&= \partial_{00} \hat{A} - \sum_m \hat{A} (-i k_m)^2 
\end{align*}

So, we have to solve

\begin{align*}
\partial_{tt} \hat{A} + \hat{A} c^2 \Bk^2 &= c \hat{J}/\epsilon_0
\end{align*}
