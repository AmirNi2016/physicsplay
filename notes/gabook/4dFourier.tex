\section{ Motivation. }

In \cite{PJfirstOrderMaxwell}, solutions of the first order Maxwell equation

\begin{align}
\grad F &= \frac{J }{\epsilon_0 c}
\end{align}

were found to be

\begin{align}
F(\Bx,t) 
&=
\inv{({2\pi})^3} \int 
e^{-i c \Bk t}
\left(
F(\Bu, 0) + \inv{\epsilon_0} \int_{\tau = -\infty}^{t} e^{i c \Bk \tau } \gamma_0 J(\Bu,\tau)  d\tau  
\right)
e^{i \Bk \cdot (\Bx-\Bu)} 
d^3 u
d^3 k
\end{align}

This doesn't have the spacetime uniformity that is expected for a solution of a Lorentz invariant equation.

Similarily, in \cite{PJfourierMaxwellSecondOrder} solutions of the second order Maxwell equation in the Lorentz gauge
$\grad \cdot A = 0$ 

\begin{align*}
F &= \grad \wedge A \\
\grad^2 A &= J/\epsilon_0 c
\end{align*}

were found to be
\begin{align}\label{eqn:fourVectorPotentials}
{A^\mu}(x)
&= \inv{\epsilon_0 c} \int J^\mu(x') G(x - x') d^4 x' \\
G(x)
&= 
\frac{u(x \cdot \gamma_0)}{ (2\pi)^3 }
\int
\sin( \Abs{\Bk} x \cdot \gamma_0 )
\exp\left( -i (\Bk \gamma_0) \cdot x \right)
\frac{d^3 k}{ \Abs{\Bk} }
\end{align}

Here our convolution kernel $G$ also doesn't exhibit a uniform four vector form that one could logically expect.

In these notes an attempt to rework these problems using a 4D spacetime Fourier transform will be made.

\section{ 4D Fourier transform. }

As before we want a multivector friendly Fourier transform pair, and choose the following

\begin{align}\label{eqn:FourierTxDefinition}
\hat{\psi}(x) &= \inv{(\sqrt{2\pi})^4} \IIinf \psi(x, t) \exp\left( -i k \cdot x \right) d^4 x \\
{\psi}(k) &= \PV \inv{(\sqrt{2\pi})^4} \IIinf \hat{\psi}(k, t) \exp\left( i k \cdot x \right) d^4 k
\end{align}
