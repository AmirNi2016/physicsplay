\section{ Mechanical wave equation solution. }

We want to solve

\begin{align}\label{eqn:waveTwoDim}
\left(\inv{v^2} \partial_{tt} - \partial_{xx}\right) \psi = 0
\end{align}

A separation of variables treatment of this has been done in
\cite{PJwaveFourVector}, and some logical followup for that done in
\cite{PJemWave} in the context of Maxwell's equation for the vacuum field.

Here the Fourier transform will be used as a tool.

\section{ do it. }

Following the heat equation treatment in \cite{PJheatFourier}, we take Fourier transforms 
of both parts of \ref{eqn:waveTwoDim}.

\begin{align*}
\FF\left( \inv{v^2} \partial_{tt} \psi \right) = \FF\left( \partial_{xx} \psi \right)
\end{align*}

For the $x$ derivatives we can integrate by parts twice

\begin{align*}
\FF\left( \partial_{xx} \psi \right)
&= \inv{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \IIinf \left( \partial_{xx} \psi \right) \exp\left( -i k x \right) dx \\
&= -\inv{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \IIinf \left( \partial_{x} \psi \right) \partial_x\left(\exp\left( -i k x \right) \right) dx \\
&= -\frac{-i k}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \IIinf \left( \partial_{x} \psi \right) \exp\left( -i k x \right) dx \\
&= \frac{(-i k)^2}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \IIinf \psi \exp\left( -i k x \right) dx \\
\end{align*}

Note that this integration by parts requires that $\partial_x \psi = \psi = 0$ at $\pm \infty$.  We are left with 

\begin{align*}
\FF\left( \partial_{xx} \psi \right) &= -k^2 \hat{\psi}(k, t)
\end{align*}

Now, for the left hand side, for the fourier transform of the time partials we can pull the derivative operation out of the 
integral

\begin{align*}
\FF\left( \inv{v^2} \partial_{tt} \psi \right) 
&= \inv{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \IIinf \left( \inv{v^2} \partial_{tt} \psi \right) \exp\left( -i k x \right) dx \\
&= \inv{v^2} \partial_{tt} \hat{\psi}(k,t) \\
\end{align*}

We are left with our harmonic oscillator differential equation for the transformed wave function

\begin{align*}
\inv{v^2} \partial_{tt} \hat{\psi}(k,t) &= -k^2 \hat{\psi}(k, t).
\end{align*}

Since we have a partial differential equation, for the integration constant we are free to pick any function of $k$.  The solutions of this are therefore of the form

\begin{align*}
\hat{\psi}(k,t) &= A(k) \exp\left( \pm i v k t \right)
\end{align*}

Performing an inverse Fourier transform we now have the wave equation expressed in terms of this unknown (so far) frequency domain function $A(k)$.  That is

\begin{align}\label{eqn:almostThere}
{\psi}(x,t) &= \inv{\sqrt{2\pi}} \IIinf A(k) \exp\left( \pm i v k t + i k x \right) dk
\end{align}

Now, suppose we fix the boundary value conditions by employing a known value of the wave function at $t = 0$, say $\psi(x,0) = \phi(x)$.  We then have

\begin{align*}
{\phi}(x) &= \inv{\sqrt{2\pi}} \IIinf A(k) \exp\left( i k x \right) dk
\end{align*}

From which we have $A(k)$ in terms of $\phi$ by inverse transform

\begin{align}\label{eqn:freqInitial}
A(k) &= \inv{\sqrt{2\pi}} \IIinf \phi(x) \exp\left( -i k x \right) dx
\end{align}

One could consider the problem fully solved at this point, but it can be carried further.  Let's substitute 
\ref{eqn:freqInitial} back into \ref{eqn:almostThere}.  This is

\begin{align*}
{\psi}(x,t) &= \inv{\sqrt{2\pi}} \IIinf \left( \inv{\sqrt{2\pi}} \IIinf \phi(u) \exp\left( -i k u \right) du \right) \exp\left( \pm i v k t + i k x \right) dk
\end{align*}

With the Rigor police on holiday, exchange the order of integration

\begin{align*}
{\psi}(x,t) 
&= \IIinf \phi(u) du \inv{{2\pi}} \IIinf \exp\left( -i k u \pm i v k t + i k x \right) dk \\
&= \IIinf \phi(u) du \inv{{2\pi}} \IIinf \exp\left( i k (x - u \pm v t ) \right) dk \\
\end{align*}

The principle value of this inner integral is

\begin{align*}
\PV \inv{{2\pi}} \IIinf \exp\left( i k (x - u \pm v t ) \right) dk 
&= \lim_{R\rightarrow \infty} \inv{2\pi} \int_{-R}^R \exp\left( i k (x - u \pm v t ) \right) dk  \\
&= \lim_{R\rightarrow \infty} \frac{\sin\left( R (x - u \pm v t ) \right) }{ \pi (x - u \pm v t) } \\
\end{align*}

And here we make the usual identification with the delta function $\delta( x - u \pm v t )$.  We are left with

\begin{align*}
{\psi}(x,t) 
&= \IIinf \phi(u) \delta( x - u \pm v t ) du \\
&= \phi( x \pm v t )
\end{align*}

We find, amazingly enough, just by application of the Fourier transform, that the time evolution of the
wave function follows propagation of the initial wave packet down the x-axis in one of the two directions with velocity $v$.

This is a statement well known to any first year student taking a vibrations and waves course, but it is nice to see 
it follow from the straightforward application of transform techniques straight out of the Engineer's toolbox.
