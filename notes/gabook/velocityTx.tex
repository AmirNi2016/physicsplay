GAFP writes $v = R \gamma_0 R^\dagger$.  This would probably be a lot more
obvious to me if I had fully read chapter 5.  Let's just expand this out
to see how this works.  First thing to note is that there is an ommitted factor
of $c$, and I'll add that back in here, since I'm not comfortable enough
without it explicitly for now.

With:

\begin{align*}
\Bv/c &= tanh(\alpha)\vcap \\
R &= \exp(\alpha \vcap/2)
\end{align*}

We want to expansion this Lorentz boost exponential (see details section) and apply it to the rest frame basis vector.  Writing
$C = \cosh(\alpha/2)$, and $S = \sinh(\alpha/2)$, we have:

\begin{align*}
v
&= R (c \gamma_0) R^\dagger \\
&= c (C + \vcap S) \gamma_0 (C - \vcap S) \\
&= c (C \gamma_0 + S \vcap \gamma_0) (C - \vcap S) \\
&= c ( C^2 \gamma_0 + SC \vcap \gamma_0 -CS \gamma_0\vcap - S^2 \vcap \gamma_0 \vcap ) \\
\end{align*}

Now, here things can start to get confusing since $\vcap$ is a spatial quantity with vector-like spacetime basis bivectors $\sigma_i = \gamma_i \gamma_0$.  Factoring out the $\gamma_0$ term, utilizing the fact that $\gamma_0$ and $\sigma_i$ anticommute (see below).

\begin{align*}
v
&= c ( C^2 + S^2 + 2 SC \vcap ) \gamma_0 \\
&= c ( \cosh(\alpha) + \vcap \sinh(\alpha) ) \gamma_0 \\
&= c \cosh(\alpha) ( 1 + \vcap \tanh(\alpha) ) \gamma_0 \\
&= c \cosh(\alpha) ( 1 + \Bv/c ) \gamma_0 \\
&= c \gamma ( 1 + \Bv/c ) \gamma_0 \\
&= \gamma ( c \gamma_0 + \sum v^i \gamma_i) \\
&= \frac{dt}{d\tau}( c \gamma_0 + \sum v^i \gamma_i) \\
&= \frac{dt}{d\tau} \frac{d}{dt}( c t \gamma_0 + \sum x^i \gamma_i) \\
&= \frac{dt}{d\tau} \frac{d}{dt} \sum x^{\mu} \gamma_{\mu} \\
&= \frac{d}{d\tau} \sum x^{\mu} \gamma_{\mu} \\
&= \frac{dx}{d\tau}
\end{align*}

So, we get the end result that demonstrates that a Lorentz boost applied to the rest event vector $x = x^0 \gamma_0 = c t \gamma_0$ does produce the desired result.

FIXME: Ahh!  This demonstrates why GAFP can do the velative velocity stuff using the ratio of wedge and dot products.  Write this up.

\section{ Appendix. Omitted details from above. }

\subsection{ exponential of a vector. } 

Understanding the vector exponential is a prerequisite above.  This is defined
and interpretted by series expansion as with matrix exponentials.
Expanding
in series the exponential of a vector $\Bx = x\xcap$, we have:

\begin{align*}
\exp(\Bx)
&= \sum \frac{\Bx^{2k}}{(2k)!} + \sum \frac{\Bx^{2k+1}}{(2k+1)!} \\
&= \sum \frac{x^{2k}}{(2k)!} + \xcap \sum \frac{x^{2k+1}}{(2k+1)!} \\
&= \cosh(x) + \xcap \sinh(x)
\end{align*}

Notationally this can also be written:

\begin{equation*}
\exp(\Bx) = \cosh(\Bx) + \sinh(\Bx)
\end{equation*}

But doing so won't really help.

\subsection{ $\Bv$ anticommutes with $\gamma_0$ }

\begin{align*}
\Bv \gamma_0 
&= \sum v^i \sigma_i \gamma_0 \\
&= \sum v^i \gamma_i \gamma_0 \gamma_0 \\
&= -\sum v^i \gamma_0 \gamma_i \gamma_0 \\
&= - \gamma_0 \sum v^i \gamma_i \gamma_0 \\
&= - \gamma_0 \sum v^i \sigma_0 \\
&= - \gamma_0 \Bv
\end{align*}
