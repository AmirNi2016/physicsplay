\section{ Motivation. }

In \cite{PJMaxwellLagrangian} Maxwell's equations were derived from
a Lagrangian action in tensor and STA forms.  This was done with 
the somewhat non-rigorous but simple direct variational technique used in
the Principle of Least Action chapter of the Feynman Lectures
\cite{feynman1963flp}.

An alternate approach is to use a field form of the Euler-Lagrange
equations as done in the wikipedia article \cite{wikiemtensor}.  I had
trouble understanding that derivation, so will try it myself, first
using Feynman's approach to derive the field versions of the Euler-Lagrange
equations.
