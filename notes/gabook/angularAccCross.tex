\section{}

Starting point is taking derivatives of:

\[
\mathbf{r} = r \rcap
\]

\[
\mathbf{v} = r' \rcap + r \rcap'
\]

It can be shown (see for example, Salus and Hille, "Calculus") that the unit vector derivative can be expressed using the cross product:

\[
\rcap' = \inv{r} (\rcap \cross \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt}) \cross \rcap..
\]

Now, one can express $r'$ in terms of $\mathbf{r}$ as well as follows:

\[
\left(\mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{r}\right)' = 2 \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{r} = 2 r r'.
\]

Thus the derivative of the vector magnitude is part of a projective term:

\[
r' = \rcap \cdot \mathbf{v}.
\]

Putting this together one has velocity in terms of projective and rejective
components along a radial direction:

\[
\mathbf{v} = \left(\rcap \cdot \mathbf{v}\right) \rcap + \left(\rcap \cross \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt}\right) \cross \rcap.
\]

Now $\boldsymbol{\omega} = \frac{\mathbf{r} \cross \mathbf{v}}{r^2}$ term is what we call the angular velocity.  The magnitude of this
is the rate of change of the angle between the radial arm and the direction of rotation.  The direction of this
cross product is normal to the plane of rotation and encodes both the rotational plane and the direction of the
rotation.  Putting these together one has the total velocity expressed radially:

\[
\mathbf{v} = \left(\rcap \cdot \mathbf{v}\right) \rcap + \boldsymbol{\omega} \cross \mathbf{r}.
\]
