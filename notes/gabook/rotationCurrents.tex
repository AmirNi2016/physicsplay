\section{Motivation}

The article (\cite{montesinos2006sem}) details the calculation for a conserved current associated with an incremental poincare transformation.  This is used to directly determine the symmetric energy momentum tensor for Maxwell's equations, in contrast to the canonical energy momentum tensor (arising from spacetime translation) which is not symmetric but can be symmetrized with other arguments.

I believe that I am slowly accumulating the tools required to understand this paper.  One of them is likely the exponential rotational generator examined in \chapcite{rotationGenerator}, utilizing the angular momentum operator.

Here I review some of the Noether conservation calculations and the associated Noether currents for a few example Lagrangian densities.  Then I hope to see how to apply similar techniques to these using an angular momentum operator alteration of the Lagrangian density.
