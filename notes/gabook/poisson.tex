\section{ Motivation.}

Having recently attempted a number of Fourier solutions to the Heat, Schr\"{o}dinger, Maxwell vacuum, and inhomogeneous Maxwell equation, a reading
of \cite{mjPerryElectrodynamics} inspired me to have another go.  In particular, he writes the Poisson equation solution explicitly in terms of a Green's 
function.

The Green's function for the Poisson equation

\begin{align}
G(\mathbf{x} - \Bx') = \frac{1}{4\pi\lvert{\mathbf{x} -\Bx'}\rvert}
\end{align}

isn't really derived, rather is just pointed out.  However, it is a nice closed form that doesn't have any integrals.
Contrast this to the Fourier transform method, where one ends up with a messy threefold 
integral that isn't particularily obvious how to integrate.

In the PF thread \href{http://www.physicsforums.com/showthread.php?t=293550}{Fourier transform solution to electrostatics Poisson equation?}
I asked if anybody knew how to reduce this integral to the
potential kernel of electrostatics.  Before getting any answer from PF I found it in 
\cite{byron1992mca}, a book recently purchased, but not yet read.


Go through this calculation here myself in full detail to get more comfort with the ideas.  Some of these ideas can probably also be applied to 
previous incomplete Fourier solution attempts.  In particular, the retarded time potential solutions likely follow.
Can these same ideas be applied to the STA form of the Maxwell equation, explicitly inverting it, as 
\cite{doran2003gap} indicate is possible (but do not spell out).

\section{ Setup. }

As often illustrated with the Heat equation, we seek a Fourier transform solution of the electrostatics Poisson equation

\begin{align}
\nabla^2 \phi &= -\rho/\epsilon_0
\end{align}

Our 3D Fourier transform pairs are defined as
\begin{align*}
\hat{f}(\mathbf{k}) &= \frac{1}{(\sqrt{2\pi})^3} \iiint f(\mathbf{x}) e^{-i \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{x} } d^3 x \\
{f}(\mathbf{x}) &= \frac{1}{(\sqrt{2\pi})^3} \iiint \hat{f}(\mathbf{k}) e^{i \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{x} } d^3 k \\
\end{align*}

Applying the transform we get

\begin{align*}
\phi(\mathbf{x}) &= \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} \iiint \rho(\mathbf{x}') G(\mathbf{x-x'}) d^3 x' \\
G(\mathbf{x}) &= \frac{1}{(2 \pi)^3} \iiint \frac{1}{\mathbf{k}^2} e^{ i \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{x} } d^3 k
\end{align*}

Now it seems to me that this integral $G$ only has to be evaluated around a small neighbourhood of the origin.  For example if one evaluates one of
the
integrals  
\begin{align*}
\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{1}{{k_1}^2 + {k_2}^2 + {k_3}^3 } e^{ i k_1 x_1 } dk_1 
\end{align*}

using a an upper half plane contour the result is zero unless $k_2 = k_3 = 0$.  So one is left with something loosely like

\begin{align*}
G(\mathbf{x}) &= \lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} \frac{1}{(2 \pi)^3} 
\int_{k_1 = -\epsilon}^{\epsilon} dk_1
\int_{k_2 = -\epsilon}^{\epsilon} dk_2
\int_{k_3 = -\epsilon}^{\epsilon} dk_3
 \frac{1}{\mathbf{k}^2} e^{ i \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{x} } 
\end{align*}

How to reduce this?  Somehow it must be possible to take this Fourier convolution kernel and somehow evaluate the integral to produce the 
electrostatics potential.  The answer of how to do so, as pointed out above, was found in
\cite{byron1992mca}, where instead of trying to evaluate this integral which has a pole at the origin, they cleverly evaluate a variant of it

\begin{align*}
\iiint \frac{1}{\mathbf{k}^2 + a^2} e^{ i \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{x} } d^3 k
\end{align*}

which splits and shifts the repeated pole into two first order poles away from the origin.
the upper and lower half planes.
After a change to spherical polar coordinates, the new integral can be evaluated, and the Poisson Green's function in potential form follows by
letting $a$ tend to zero.

Very cool.
