\section{ Motivation. }

In \cite{PJwaveFourVector} four vector solutions to the mechanical wave
equations were explored.  What was obviously missing from that 
was consideration of the special case for $\Bv^2 = c^2$.

Here solutions to the electrodynamic wave equation will be examined.
Consideration of such solutions in more detail will is expected
to be helpful 
as background for the more complex study of quantum (matter) wave equations.

\section{ Electromagnetic wave equation solutions. }

For electrodynamics our equation to solve is

\begin{align*}
\grad F = J/\epsilon_0 c
\end{align*}

For the unforced (vacuum) solutions, with 
$F = \grad \wedge A$, and the Coulomb gauge $\grad \cdot A = 0$ this 
reduces to

\begin{align*}
0 
&= \left((\gamma^\mu)^2 \partial_{\mu\mu}\right) A  \\
&= \left( \inv{c^2}\partial_{tt} -\partial_{jj} \right) A
\end{align*}

These equations have the same form as the mechanical wave equation
where the wave velocity $\Bv^2 = c^2$ is the speed of light

\begin{align}\label{eqn:waveEquation}
\left( \inv{\Bv^2} \partial_{tt} - \sum_{j=1}^3 \partial_{jj}\right) \psi = 0
\end{align}

\subsection{ Separation of variables solution of potential equations. }

Let's solve this using separation of variables, and write $A^\nu = X Y Z T = \Pi_{\mu} X^{\mu}$

From this we have

\begin{align*}
\sum_\mu (\gamma^\mu)^2 \frac{(X^\mu)''}{X^\mu} = 0
\end{align*}

and can procede with the normal procedure of assuming that a solution can be
found by separately equating each term to a constant.  Writing those
constants explicitly as $(m_\mu)^2$, which we allow to be potentially complex
we have (no sum) 

\begin{align*}
X^\mu = \exp\left( \pm \sqrt{(\gamma^\mu)^2} m_\mu x^\mu \right)
\end{align*}

Now, let $k_\mu = \pm \sqrt{(\gamma^\mu)^2} m_\mu$, folding any sign variation
and complex factors into these constants.  Our complete solution
is thus

\begin{align*}
\Pi_\mu X^\mu = \exp\left( \sum k_\mu x^\mu \right)
\end{align*}

However, for this to be a solution, the wave equation imposes the constraint

\begin{align*}
\sum_\mu (\gamma^\mu)^2 (k_\mu)^2 = 0
\end{align*}

Or
\begin{align*}
(k_0)^2 - \sum_j (k_j)^2 = 0
\end{align*}

Summarizing each potential term has a solution expressable in terms of 
null "wave-number" vectors $K_\nu$

\begin{align}\label{eqn:potentialSolution}
A_\nu &= \exp\left( K_\nu \cdot x \right)  \\
\Abs{K_\nu} &= 0
\end{align}

\subsection{ Faraday bivector and tensor from the potential solutions. }

From the components of the potentials 
\ref{eqn:potentialSolution}
we can compute the curl for the complete
field.  That is

\begin{align*}
F &= \grad \wedge A \\
A &= \gamma^\nu \exp\left( K_\nu \cdot x \right)  \\
\end{align*}

This is

\begin{align*}
F 
&= \left(\gamma^\mu \wedge \gamma^\nu\right) \partial_\mu \exp\left( K_\nu \cdot x \right) \\
&= \left(\gamma^\mu \wedge \gamma^\nu\right) \partial_\mu \exp\left( \gamma^\alpha K_{\nu\alpha} \cdot \gamma_\sigma x^\sigma \right) \\
&= \left(\gamma^\mu \wedge \gamma^\nu\right) \partial_\mu \exp\left( K_{\nu\sigma} x^\sigma \right) \\
%&= \left(\gamma^\mu \wedge \gamma^\nu\right) K_{\nu\sigma} \delta_\mu\sigma \exp\left( K_{\nu\sigma} x^\sigma \right) \\
&= \left(\gamma^\mu \wedge \gamma^\nu\right) K_{\nu\mu} \exp\left( K_{\nu\sigma} x^\sigma \right) \\
&= \left(\gamma^\mu \wedge \gamma^\nu\right) K_{\nu\mu} \exp\left( K_{\nu} \cdot x \right) \\
&= \left(\gamma^\mu \wedge \gamma^\nu\right) 
\inv{2} \left( K_{\nu\mu} \exp\left( K_{\nu} \cdot x \right) - K_{\mu\nu} \exp\left( K_{\mu} \cdot x \right) \right) \\
\end{align*}

Writing our field in explicit tensor form

\begin{align*}
F = F_{\mu\nu} \gamma^\mu \wedge \gamma^\nu
\end{align*}

our vacuum solution is therefore

\begin{align}
F_{\mu\nu} &= \inv{2} \left( K_{\nu\mu} \exp\left( K_{\nu} \cdot x \right) - K_{\mu\nu} \exp\left( K_{\mu} \cdot x \right) \right) 
\end{align}

but subject to the null wave number and Lorentz guage constraints

\begin{align}
\Abs{K_\mu} &= 0 \\
\grad \cdot \left(\gamma^\mu \exp\left( K_\mu \cdot x \right)\right) &= 0
\end{align}

\subsection{ Examine the Lorentz gauge constraint. }

That Lorentz gauge constraint on the potential is a curious looking beastie.  Let's expand that out in full to examine it closer

\begin{align*}
\grad \cdot \left(\gamma^\mu \exp\left( K_\mu \cdot x \right)\right) 
&= \gamma^\alpha \partial_\alpha \cdot \left(\gamma^\mu \exp\left( K_\mu \cdot x \right)\right)  \\
&= \sum_\mu (\gamma^\mu)^2 \partial_\mu \exp\left( K_\mu \cdot x \right) \\
&= \sum_\mu (\gamma^\mu)^2 \partial_\mu \exp\left( \sum \gamma^\nu K_{\mu\nu} \cdot \gamma_\alpha x^\alpha \right) \\
&= \sum_\mu (\gamma^\mu)^2 \partial_\mu \exp\left( \sum K_{\mu\alpha} x^\alpha \right) \\
&= \sum_\mu (\gamma^\mu)^2 K_{\mu\mu} \exp\left( K_\mu \cdot x \right)
\end{align*}

If this must be zero for any $x$ it must also be zero for $x =0$, so the Lorentz gauge imposes an additional restriction on the
wave number four vectors $K_\mu$

\begin{align*}
\sum_\mu (\gamma^\mu)^2 K_{\mu\mu} = 0 
\end{align*}

Expanding in time and spatial coordinates this is

\begin{align*}
K_{00} - \sum_j K_{jj} = 0 
\end{align*}

One obvious way to satisfy this is to require that the tensor $K_{\mu\nu}$ be diagonal, but since we also have the null vector requirement
on each of the $K_\mu$ four vectors it isn't clear that this is an acceptable choice.

\subsection{ Summarizing so far. }

We have found that our field solution has the form

\begin{align*}
F_{\mu\nu} &= \inv{2} \left( K_{\nu\mu} \exp\left( K_{\nu} \cdot x \right) - K_{\mu\nu} \exp\left( K_{\mu} \cdot x \right) \right) \\
\end{align*}

Where
\begin{align*}
K_\mu &= \gamma^\nu K_{\mu\nu} \\
x &= \gamma_\mu x^\mu
\end{align*}

with constraints
\begin{align*}
0 &= \sum_\mu (\gamma^\mu)^2 K_{\mu\mu} \\
0 &= \sum_\mu (\gamma^\mu)^2 (K_{\nu\mu})^2
\end{align*}

Alternately, calling out the explict space time split of the constraint, we can
remove the explicit $\gamma^\mu$ factors 

\begin{align*}
0 = K_{00} - \sum_j K_{jj} = (K_{00})^2 - \sum_j (K_{jj} )^2
\end{align*}

%If each of $K_{\mu0} \ne 0$ we could alternately remove the explicit $\gamma^\mu$ factors and write
%
%\begin{align*}
%1 = \sum_j \frac{K_{jj}}{K_{00}} = \sum_j \left(\frac{K_{jj}}{K_{00}}\right)^2 
%\end{align*}
%
%Is this any better?
