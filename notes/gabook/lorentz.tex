\section{intro.}

Many introductory relativity texts mention how Lorentz observed that 
while Maxwells equations were not invarient with respect to Galelian
transformation, they were with his modified transformation.

I found it interesting to consider this statement with a bit of detail.

\section{}

From Maxwell's equations one can show that the electric field and magnetic field both satisfy the wave equation:

\begin{equation}
\laplacian - \inv{c^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} = 0 
\end{equation}

The wikipedia article Electromagnetic radiation (under Derivation)

%\htmladdnormallink{<URL>} { http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation#Derivation }

goes over this nicely.

Although this can be solved separately for either $\BE$ or $\BB$ the two are not independent.
This dependence is nicely expressed by writing the electromagnetic field as a complete
bivector $\BF = \BE + i c \BB$, and in that form the 
general solution to this equation for the combined electromagnetic
field is:

\begin{equation}
\BF = (\BE_0 + \kcap \wedge \BE_0) f( \kcap \cdot \Br \pm c t)
\end{equation}

Here f is any function, and represents the amplitude of the waveform.

\section{Verifing Lorentz invarience.}

The Lorentz transfrom for a moving (primed) frame where the motion is
along the x axis is:

\begin{equation*}
\begin{bmatrix}
x' \\
c t' \\
\end{bmatrix}
=
\gamma
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -\beta \\
-\beta & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}

Or,
\begin{equation*}
\begin{bmatrix}
x \\
c t \\
\end{bmatrix}
=
\gamma
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & \beta \\
\beta & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}

Using this we can express the partials of the wave equation in the 
primed frame.  Starting with the first derivatives:

\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial}{\partial x} 
&= \frac{\partial x'}{\partial x} \frac{\partial}{\partial x'} + \frac{\partial c t'}{\partial x} \frac{\partial}{\partial c t'} \\
&= \gamma \frac{\partial}{\partial x'} - \gamma \beta \frac{\partial}{\partial c t'} \\
\end{align*}

And:

\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial}{\partial ct} 
&= \frac{\partial x'}{\partial ct} \frac{\partial}{\partial x'} + \frac{\partial c t'}{\partial ct} \frac{\partial}{\partial c t'} \\
&= -\beta \gamma \frac{\partial}{\partial x'} + \gamma \frac{\partial}{\partial c t'} \\
\end{align*}

...
