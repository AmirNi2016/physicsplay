\section{Motivation}

In (\cite{maxwellVacuum}) a phasor like form of the transverse wave equation was derived by considering Fourier solutions of the Maxwell equation.  Curiously no perpendicularity condition for $\BE$ and $\BB$ seemed to be required in general.  Why would that be the case when starting with the GA form of Maxwell's equation but not when starting with the traditional equations?

Here we start with the equations from Jackson (\cite{jackson1975cew}, ch7), expressed in GA form.  With the same assumption for the phasor form we should get the same resuls using GA.  If not there's trouble.  Try to account for the apparent differences after doing this.
