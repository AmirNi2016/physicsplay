\section{ Fourier series. }

In \cite{bohm1989qt}, 
after finding a formulation of Maxwell's equations that he likes, Bohm's next
step is to assume the electric and magnetic fields can be expressed in 
a 3D Fourier series form, with periodicity in some repeated volume 
of space, and then procedes to evaluate the energy of the 
field.

Let's try this.  Instead of using the sine and cosine fourier series
which looks more complex than it ought to be, use of a complex exponential
ought to be cleaner.

\subsection{ 3D Fourier series in complex exponential form. }

For a multivector function $f(\Bx, t)$, periodic in some rectangular spatial volume, let's assume that we have a
3D Fourier series representation.

Define the element of volume for our fundamental wavelengths to be the region bounded by three intervals in the $x^1, x^2, x^3$ directions respectively

\begin{align*}
I_1 &= [ a^1, a^1 + \lambda_1 ] \\
I_2 &= [ a^2, a^2 + \lambda_2 ] \\
I_3 &= [ a^3, a^3 + \lambda_3 ] \\
\end{align*}

Our assumed Fourier representation is then

\begin{align*}
f(\Bx, t) &= \sum_{\Bk} \hat{f}(\Bk, t) \exp\left( - \sum_j \frac{2 \pi i k_j}{\lambda_j} x^j\right)
\end{align*}

Here $\Bk = (k_1, k_2, k_3)$ is a triplet of integer values, and takes on all integers in the $[-\infty, \infty]$ range.

We also wish to allow $i$ to not just be a generic complex number, but allow for the use of either the Euclidian or Minkowski pseudoscalar

\begin{align*}
i = \gamma_0 \gamma_1 \gamma_2 \gamma_3 = \sigma_1 \sigma_2 \sigma_3
\end{align*}

Because of this we should not assume that we can commute $i$, or our exponentials with the functions $f(\Bx,t)$, or $\hat{f}(\Bk,t)$.

\begin{align*}
\int_{x^1 = \partial I_1} &\int_{x^2 = \partial I_2} \int_{x^3 = \partial I_3} f(\Bx, t) 
e^{ 2 \pi i m_j x^j/\lambda_j}
dx^1 dx^2 dx^3 \\
&= \sum_{\Bk} \hat{f}(\Bk, t) \int_{x^1 = \partial I_1} \int_{x^2 = \partial I_2} \int_{x^3 = \partial I_3} dx^1 dx^2 dx^3 e^{ 2 \pi i (m_j - k_j) x^j/\lambda_j} dx^1 dx^2 dx^3
\end{align*}

But each of these integrals is just $\delta_{\Bk,\Bm} \lambda_1 \lambda_2 \lambda_3$, giving us

\begin{align*}
\hat{f}(\Bk, t)
&= \inv{\lambda_1 \lambda_2 \lambda_3 } \int_{x^1 = \partial I_1} \int_{x^2 = \partial I_2} \int_{x^3 = \partial I_3} f(\Bx, t) \exp\left( \sum_j \frac{2 \pi i k_j x^j}{\lambda_j} \right) dx^1 dx^2 dx^3 \\
\end{align*}

For short lets write this as

\begin{align}
f(\Bx, t) &= \sum_{\Bk} \hat{f}(\Bk, t) \exp\left( - \frac{2 \pi i k_j x^j }{\lambda_j} \right) \\
\hat{f}(\Bk, t) &= \inv{V} \int f(\Bx, t) \exp\left( \frac{2 \pi i k_j x^j}{\lambda_j} \right) d^3 x
\end{align}

\subsection{ Vacuum equation. }

Now that we have a desirable seeming Fourier series representation, we 
want to apply this to Maxwell's equation for the vacuum.  We will use the 
STA formulation of Maxwell's equation, but use the unit convention of Bohm's
book.

In \cite{PJrayleighJeans} the STA equivalent to Bohm's notation for Maxwell's equations was found to be

\begin{align}
F &= \EE + i\HH \\
J &= (\rho + \Bj) \gamma_0 \\
\grad F &= 4 \pi J
\end{align}

For the vacuum equation, we make an explicit spacetime split by premultiplying with $\gamma_0$

\begin{align*}
\gamma_0 \grad 
&= \gamma_0 (\gamma^0 \partial_0 + \gamma^k \partial_k) \\
&= \partial_0 - \gamma^k \gamma_0 \partial_k \\
&= \partial_0 + \gamma_k \gamma_0 \partial_k \\
&= \partial_0 + \sigma_k \partial_k \\
&= \partial_0 + \spacegrad \\
\end{align*}

So our vacuum equation is just

\begin{align}
(\partial_0 + \spacegrad) F = 0
\end{align}
