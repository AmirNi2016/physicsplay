This is a compilation of Geometric Algebra related notes on mathematics and
physics.

What can be found here is an exploratory record of learning.  This is much different than what you'll find in a polished textbook where the author knows the subject like the back of his hand.  A reader here should not be surprised to find that I don't always know where I am going or what the final result will be ahead of time.  I sometimes hit dead ends, mistakes, or unproductive paths.  These are not always deleted since I feel there is personal educational value to exploring the thought process.  I have at least tried to go back and correct (or at least point out) errors if I realize I've made them.

I end up typing up notes on what I have learned, or to write as I am learning, or to learn by writing.  I've personally found that the process of writing up one's thoughts on a subject as if explaining to somebody is very educational.  I can't count the times when doing so has led to learning something else very interesting or discovering that something was not actually as well understood as initially believed.

Since these notes are primarily for my personal benefit as an educational tool, I can't promise that I explain things in a way that is good for anybody else.  My audience is essentially myself as I existed at the time of writing.  The prerequisites, both for the mathematics and the physics, evolve continually.  What I cover is often done to clarify aspects of the texts I personally own that didn't happen to explain with the level of detail desired when I first read them.  Because I am trying to remedy aspects that I did understand and not the parts that I understood, the complete sort of content required for others to learn from in isolation may very well be missing.

A fair amount of this hodge podge set of Geometric Algebra notes 
was in response to study of \cite{doran2003gap} and
\cite{hestenes1999nfc}.  The first of which has many particularily hard to 
grasp elements since the physics prerequisites are high, and the book itself
is not self contained since those prerequisites are assumed (it is after
all a book for Physisists, not systems level software developers with 
curiousity about physics.)

Since the original notes of this compilation were disconnected the
assembled form is not neccessarily in a logical sequence.  There will also
be a fair amount of repetition that one would not find in a carefully
crafted text.  Hopefully some subset of this material is useful
even without the original texts that motivated many of the topics.

Please feel free to contact me with 
comments, questions, suggestions, and any observations of errors and typos.
