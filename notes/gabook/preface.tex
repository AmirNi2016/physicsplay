Start compiling my hodge podge set of Geometric Algebra notes into a coherent unit.  Want a treatment that is more
understandable than that of 
\cite{doran2003gap} or 
\cite{hestenes1999nfc}.
This may be hard since so many of these notes are disconnected, and as
is do not necessarily build in a logical sequence.  Many of these 
notes were an attempt to provide motivation for things presented in
an unmotivated fashion in other locations, but ironically this probably
means that much of the content here will be unmotivated since this 
is the gaps but not the meat of other treatments.
