\section{ Motivation. }

Doran/Lasenby use a $+,-,-,-$ signature, and I had gotten used to that.  On first seeing the alternate signature used by John Denker's excellent 
explainatory paper:

http://www.av8n.com/physics/maxwell-ga.pdf

I found myself disoriented.  How many of the identities that I was used to were metric dependent?   Here are some notes that explore the 
metric dependencies of STA, in particular observing which identities are metric dependent and which aren't.

\subsection{ spatial basis }

Our spatial (bivector) basis:

\begin{equation*}
\sigma_i = \gamma_i \wedge \gamma_0 = \gamma_{i0},
\end{equation*}

that behaves like Euclidean vectors (positive square) still behave as desired, regardless of the signature:

\begin{align*}
\sigma_i \cdot \sigma_j 
&= \gpgradezero{\gamma_{i0j0}}  \\
&= - \gpgradezero{\gamma_{ij}} \gamma_{00}  \\
&= -\delta_{ij} {\gamma_i}^2 \gamma_{00}
\end{align*}

Regardless of the signature the pair of products ${\gamma_i}^2 \gamma_{00} = -1$, so our spatial bivectors are metric invariant.

\subsection{ How about commutation? }

Commutation with 
\begin{equation*}
i \gamma_{\mu} = \gamma_{0123\mu} = \gamma_{\mu0123}
\end{equation*}

$\mu$ has to "pass" three indexes regardless of metric, so anticommutes for any $\mu$.

\begin{equation*}
\sigma_k \gamma_{\mu} = \gamma_{k0\mu}
\end{equation*}

If $k = \mu$, or $0 = \mu$, then we get a sign inversion, and otherwise commute (pass two indexes).  This is also metric invariant.

\subsection{ Electrodynamic tensor. }

John Denker's paper writes:

\begin{equation*}
F = (\BE + ic\BB) \gamma_0
\end{equation*}

with
\begin{align*}
\BE &= E^i \gamma_i \\
\BB &= B^i \gamma_i
\end{align*}

Since he uses the postive end of the metric for spatial indexes this works fine.  Contrast to Doran/Lasenby who write:

\begin{equation*}
F = \BE + ic\BB
\end{equation*}

with the following implied spatial bivector representation:
\begin{align*}
\BE &= E^i \sigma_i = E^i \gamma_{i0} \\
\BB &= B^i \sigma_i = B^i \gamma_{i0}
\end{align*}

(that implied representation wasn't obvious to me, but I eventually figured out what they meant).

The end result in both cases is a pure bivector representation for the complete field:

\begin{equation*}
F = E^j \gamma_{j0} + icB^j \gamma_{j0}
\end{equation*}

Let's look at the $B^j$ basis bivectors a bit more closely:

\begin{equation*}
i\gamma_{j0} 
= \gamma_{0123j0}
= -\gamma_{01230j}
= +\gamma_{00123j}
= (\gamma_0)^2 \gamma_{123j}
\end{equation*}

Where, 
\begin{equation*}
\gamma_{123j} = 
(\gamma_{j})^2
\left\{ 
\begin{array}{l l}
& \gamma_{31} \quad \mbox{if $j = 1$} \\
& \gamma_{23} \quad \mbox{if $j = 2$} \\
& \gamma_{12} \quad \mbox{if $j = 3$} \\
\end{array} \right.
\end{equation*}

Combining these results we have a $(\gamma_0)^2 (\gamma_{j})^2 = -1$ coefficient that is metric invariant, and can write:

\begin{equation*}
i \gamma_{j0} = 
\left\{ 
\begin{array}{l l}
& \gamma_{13} \quad \mbox{if $j = 1$} \\
& \gamma_{32} \quad \mbox{if $j = 2$} \\
& \gamma_{21} \quad \mbox{if $j = 3$} \\
\end{array} \right.
\end{equation*}
