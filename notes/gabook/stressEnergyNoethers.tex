\section{ Summary. }

In \ref{chap:PJstressEnergyLorentz} we saw that it was
possible to express the Lorentz force equation for the charge per unit
volume in terms of the stress energy tensor.

Repeating from \ref{eqn:seLorentz:lorentzForceT} and
\ref{eqn:seLorentz:seTensorVecForm}

\begin{align}
\grad \cdot T(\gamma_\mu) &= \inv{c} \gpgradezero{ F \gamma_\mu J } \\
T(a) &= \frac{\epsilon_0}{2} F a \tilde{F}
\end{align}

While these
may not appear too much like the Lorentz force equation as we are used
to seeing it, with some manipulation we found 
\ref{eqn:seLorentz:lorentzForcePair}

\begin{align}
\inv{c} \gpgradezero{ F \gamma_0 J } &= -\Bj \cdot \BE \\
\inv{c} \gpgradezero{ F \gamma_k J } &= (\rho \BE + \Bj \cross \BB) \cdot \sigma_k
\end{align}

where we now have an energy momentum pair of equations, the second
of which if integrated over a volume is the Lorentz force for the charge
in that volume.

We've also seen in
%\ref{eqn:seLorentz:lorentzForceGA}
that we can express the Lorentz force equation in GA form
\begin{align}
m \ddot{x} &= q F \cdot \dot{x}/c
\end{align}

In 
%\ref{eqn:seLorentz:lorentzForceTensor}
this was expressed in tensor form, toggling indexes that was
\begin{align}
m \ddot{x}_\mu &= {q} F_{\mu\alpha} \dot{x}^\alpha
\end{align}

We then saw in
\ref{chap:en_m_tensor}
in equations \ref{eqn:stressEnTen:miracle} and
\ref{eqn:stressEnTen:covariantTensor}, that the
the covariant form of the stress energy tensor relation was

\begin{align}
T^{\mu\nu} &= {\epsilon_0} \left( F^{\alpha\mu} {F^{\nu}}_{\alpha} + \inv{4} F^{\alpha\beta} F_{\alpha\beta} \eta^{\mu\nu} \right) \\
\partial_\nu T^{\mu\nu} &= F^{\alpha\mu} J_\alpha/c
\end{align}

this has identical structure (FIXME: sign error here?) to the
covariant Lorentz force equation.

Now the stress energy conservation equations above did not require
the Lorentz force equations at all for their derivation, nor have we
used the Lorentz force interaction Lagrangian to arrive at them.  
With Maxwell's equation and the Lorentz force equation together (
or the equivalent field and interaction Lagrangians) we have
the complete specificiation of classical electrodynamics.  Curiously
it
appears that we have most of the structure of the Lorentz force equation
(except for the association with mass) all in embedded in Maxwell's equation
or the Maxwell field Lagrangian.  For this reason it seems desirable to
understand the background behind the stress energy tensor much better.
In particular, it is natural to then expect that these conservation
relations may also be found as a 
consequence of a symmetry and an associated Noether current.  What
is that symmetry?  Given that symmetry how would one go about
actually showing that this is the case?   These are the questions
to tackle here.

\section{ Symmetry due to total derivative addition to the Lagrangian }

In \cite{doran2003gap} the stress energy tensor is treated 
by considering spacetime translation, but I've unfortunately
not understood much more than vague direction in that treatment.

In \cite{srednicki2007qft} it is also stated that the stress energy tensor
is the result of a Lagrangian spacetime translation, but I didn't find
details there.

There is also fairly extensive treatment
of the stress energy tensor (in the simpler non-GA tensor form) in
\cite{jackson1975cew}.  However, that treatment relies on analogy with
mechanical form of Noether's theorem, and I'd rather see it developed
explicitly.

In an unexpected place, the 
clue required to understand the details of 
how this spacetime translation results in the stress energy tensor
was found in
\cite{TongQFT}.

In Tong's treatment it is pointed out there is a symmetry for the Lagrangian
if it is altered by a divergence.

\begin{align*}
\LL \rightarrow \LL + \partial_\mu F^\mu
\end{align*}

It took me a while to figure out how this was a symmetry, but after a
nice refreshing motorcycle ride, the answer suddenly surfaced.  One
can add a derivative to a mechanical Lagrangian and not change
the resulting equations of motion.  While tackling problem 5 of 
Tong's mechanics, such an invariance was considered in
detail
\ref{chap:PJTongMf1:addDerivative}.  No Noether current was 
derived for this sort of mechanical symmetry.  From
what I've read, such a Noether's current calculation is 
likely to provide a demonstration of linear momentum conservation.  This
is worthy of explicit followup, but not now.
