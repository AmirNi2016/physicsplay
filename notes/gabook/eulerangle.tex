\section{ Removing the rotors from the exponentials. }

In \cite{doran2003gap} section 2.7.5 the euler angle formula is 
developed for $\{z,x',z''\}$ axis rotations by $\{\phi, \theta, \psi\}$
respectively.

Other than a few details the derivation is pretty straightforward.  Equation
2.153 would be clearer with a series expansion hint like

\begin{align*}
\exp(R \alpha i R^\dagger) 
&= \sum_k \inv{k!} (R \alpha i R^\dagger)^k \\
&= \sum_k \inv{k!} R (\alpha i)^k R^\dagger \\
&= R \exp(\alpha i) R^\dagger
\end{align*}

where $i$ is a bivector, and $R$ is a rotor.

\section{ In matrix form. }

The end result of the composite Euler rotations is that the rotation is

\begin{align*}
R(x) &= R x R^\dagger \\
R &= \exp(-e_{12}\phi/2) \exp(-e_{23}\theta/2) \exp(-e_{12}\psi/2)
\end{align*}

Then there are notes saying this is easier to visualize and work with than
the equivalent matrix formula.  Let's see what the equivalent matrix formula
is
