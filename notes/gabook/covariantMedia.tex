\section{Motivation}

Adjusting to Jackson's of CGS (\cite{jackson1975cew}) takes some work.  In non-covariant form we could write Maxwell's equation in abscence of current and charge as

\begin{align}\label{eqn:foo1}
F &= \BE + I\BB/\sqrt{\mu\epsilon} \\
0 &= (\spacegrad + \sqrt{\mu\epsilon} \partial_0) F 
\end{align}

To examine the energy momentum tensor, it is desirable to express this in a fashion that has no such explicit spacetime dependence.  This suggests a spacetime gradient definition that varies throughout the media.

\begin{align}\label{eqn:foo2}
\grad \equiv \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu + \sqrt{\mu\epsilon} \gamma^0 \partial_0
\end{align}

With this we can express Maxwell's equation in the neighbourhood of a point in which $\mu\epsilon$ is constant as

\begin{align}\label{eqn:foo3}
\grad F = 0
\end{align}

However, we want the a varient of this that includes the charge and current terms.
