\section{Motivation}

Relying on pictorial means and a brute force ugly comparison of left and right hand sides, a verification of Stokes theorem for the vector and bivector cases was performed.  This was more of a confirmation than a derivation, and the technique fails the transition to the trivector case.  The trivector case is of particular interest in electromagnetism since it provides the four-vector divergence theorem equivalent via a duality transformation.

The fact that the pictorial means of defining the boundary surface doens't work well in four vector space is not the only unsatisfactory aspect of the previous treatment.  The fact that a coordinate expansion of the hypervolume element and hypersurface element was performed in the LHS and RHS comparisions was required is particularily ugly.  It is a lot of work and essentially has to be undone on the opposing side of the equation.  Comparing to previous attempts to come to terms with Stokes theorem in (\cite{PJStokes1}) and (\cite{PJStokes2}) this more recent attempt at least avoids the requirement for a tensor expansion of the vector or bivector.  It should be possible to build on this and minimize the amount of coordinate expansion required and go directly from the volume integral to the expression of the boundary surface.

\section{Notation and Setup.}

The desire is to relate the curl hypervolume integral to a hypersurface integral on the boundary

\begin{align}\label{eqn:stokes}
\int (\grad \wedge F) \cdot d^k x = \int F \cdot d^{k-1} x
\end{align}

In order to put meaning to this statement the volume and surface elements need to be properly defined.  In order that this be a scalar equation, the object $F$ in the integral is required to be of grade $k-1$, and $k \le n$ where $n$ is the dimension of the vector space that generates the object $F$.

As evident in equation (\ref{eqn:stokes}) a metric is required to define the dot product.  If an affine non-metric formulation
of Stokes theorem is possible it will not be attempted here.  A reciprocal basis pair will be utilized, defined by

\begin{align}
\gamma^\mu \cdot \gamma_\nu = {\delta^\mu}_\nu
\end{align}

Both of the sets $\{\gamma_\mu\}$ and $\{\gamma^\mu\}$ are taken to span the space, but are not required to be orthogonal.  The notation is consistent with the Dirac reciprocal basis, and there will not be anything in this treatment that prohibits the Minkowski metric signature required for such a relativistic space.

Vector decomposition in terms of coordinates follows by taking dot products.  We write

\begin{align}
x = x^\mu \gamma_\mu = x_\nu \gamma^\nu
\end{align}

In particular, we write the gradient as

\begin{align}
\grad \equiv \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \equiv \sum_\mu \gamma^\mu \PD{x^\mu}{}
\end{align}

The perhaps odd seeming mix of upper and lower indexes in this definition is required to make the directional derivative take the right form.  Writing the directional derivative the usual way

\begin{align}
a \cdot \grad F \equiv \lim_{\tau \rightarrow 0} \frac{F(x + a\tau) - F(x)}{\tau} = {\left.\PD{\tau}{F(x + a\tau)} \right\vert}_{\tau=0}
\end{align}

It can be verified that the directional derivative in terms of coordinates can be written as $a \cdot \grad = a^\mu \partial_\mu$, which then requires the upper index basis vectors in the gradient definition

\begin{align*}
a^\mu \partial_\mu 
&= (a^\nu \gamma_\nu) \cdot \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \\
&= a \cdot \grad 
\end{align*}

The hypervolume element will be defined in terms of a vector parameteriation.
