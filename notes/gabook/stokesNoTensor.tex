\section{Motivation}

Relying on pictorial means and a brute force ugly comparison of left and right hand sides, a verification of Stokes theorem for the vector and bivector cases was performed.  This was more of a confirmation than a derivation, and the technique fails the transition to the trivector case.  The trivector case is of particular interest in electromagnetism since it provides the four-vector divergence theorem equivalent via a duality transformation.

The fact that the pictorial means of defining the boundary surface doens't work well in four vector space is not the only unsatisfactory aspect of the previous treatment.  The fact that a coordinate expansion of the hypervolume element and hypersurface element was performed in the LHS and RHS comparisions was required is particularily ugly.  It is a lot of work and essentially has to be undone on the opposing side of the equation.  Comparing to previous attempts to come to terms with Stokes theorem in (\cite{PJStokes1}) and (\cite{PJStokes2}) this more recent attempt at least avoids the requirement for a tensor expansion of the vector or bivector.  It should be possible to build on this and minimize the amount of coordinate expansion required and go directly from the volume integral to the expression of the boundary surface.
