One can show that the grade zero component of a multivector product 
is independent of the order of the terms:

\begin{equation}
\gpgradezero{AB} = \gpgradezero{BA}
\end{equation}

Doran/Lasenby has an elegant proof of this, but a dumber proof using an
explicit expansion by basis also works and highlights the similarities
with the standard component definition of the vector dot product.

Writing:

\[
A = \sum_i \gpgrade{A}{i}
\]
\[
B = \sum_i \gpgrade{B}{i}
\]

The product of $A$ and $B is:

\begin{align*}
AB 
&= \sum_{ij} \gpgrade{A}{i} \gpgrade{B}{j} \\
&= \sum_{ij} \sum_{k=0}^{\min(i,j)}\gpgrade{\gpgrade{A}{i} \gpgrade{B}{j}}{2k + \abs{i-j}} \\
\end{align*}
