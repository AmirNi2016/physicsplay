\section{ Motivation. }

In \cite{PJFourierVacuum} an exploration of spatially periodic solutions to the electrodynamic vacuum equation was performed using a multivector formulation 
of a 3D Fourier series.
Here a summary of the results obtained will be presented in a more
coherent fashion, followed by an attempt to build on them.
In particular a complete
description of the field energy and momentum is desired.

A conclusion from the first analysis was that the
orientation of both the electric and magnetic field components
must be perpendicular to the angular velocity and wave number vectors 
within the entire spatial volume.  This was a requirement for the field
solutions to retain a bivector grade (STA/Dirac basis).

Here a specific orientation of the Fourier volume so that two of the axis
lie in the direction of the initial time electric and magnetic fields will be
used.  This is expected to simplify the treatment.

Also note that having obtained some results in a first attempt hindsight
now allows a few choices of variables that will be seen to be appropriate.
The natural motivation for any such choices can be found in the initial
treatment.

\subsection{ Notation. }

Conventions, definitions, and notation used here will largely follow
\cite{PJFourierVacuum}.  Also of possible aid in that document is a 
a table of symbols and their definitions.

\section{ A consise review of results. }

A Fourier series and the Fourier coefficients are

\begin{align}
f(\Bx) &= \sum_{\Bk} \hat{f}_{\Bk} e^{ - i \Bk \cdot \Bx } \\
\hat{f}_{\Bk} &= \inv{V} \int f(\Bx) e^{ i \Bk \cdot \Bx } d^3 x
\end{align}

In the vector context $\Bk$ is

\begin{align}
\Bk = 2 \pi \sum_m \sigma^m \frac{k_m}{\lambda_m}
\end{align}

Where $\lambda_m$ are the dimensions of the volume of integration, 
$V = \lambda_1 \lambda_2 \lambda_3$ is the volume, and
in an index context $\Bk = \{k_1, k_2, k_3\}$ is a triplet of integers,
positive, negative or zero.

\subsection{ Fourier series and coefficients. }

We want to find (STA) bivector solutions $F$ to the vacuum Maxwell equation

\begin{align}
\grad F = \gamma_0 (\partial_0 + \spacegrad) F = 0
\end{align}

We start by assuming a Fourier series solution of the form

\begin{align}
F(\Bx,t) &= \sum_{\Bk} \hat{F}_{\Bk} e^{-i \Bk \cdot \Bx} 
\end{align}
