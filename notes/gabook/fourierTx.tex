In \cite{mcmahon2005qmd} the Fourier transform pairs are written in a somewhat 
non-orthogox seeming way.

\begin{align*}
\phi(p) &= \inv{\sqrt{2\pi\hbar}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \psi(x) e^{-ipx/\hbar} dx \\
\psi(x) &= \inv{\sqrt{2\pi\hbar}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \phi(p) e^{ipx/\hbar} dp \\
\end{align*}

As an exersize to verify, in a not particularily rigorous fashion, that we get back our original function applying the forward and reverse transformations
in sequence.  Specifically, let's compute

\begin{align*}
\FF^{-1}(\FF(\psi(x)))
&= \PV \inv{\sqrt{2\pi\hbar}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \left(\inv{\sqrt{2\pi\hbar}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \psi(u) e^{-ipu/\hbar} du \right) e^{ipx/\hbar} dp \\
\end{align*}

Here $\PV$ is the principle value of the integral, which is the specifically symmetric integration

\begin{align*}
\PV \int_{-\infty}^\infty &= \lim_{R \rightarrow \infty} \int_{-R}^R
\end{align*}

We have for the integration
\begin{align*}
\FF^{-1}(\FF(\psi(x)))
&= \PV \inv{{2\pi\hbar}} \int du \psi(u) \int e^{i p (x-u)/\hbar} dp \\
\end{align*}

Now, let $v = (x-u)/\hbar$, or $u=x-v\hbar$ for

\begin{align*}
\inv{{2\pi}} \int dv \psi(x -v\hbar) \int_{-R}^R e^{i p v} dp 
&= \inv{{2\pi}} \int dv \psi(x - v\hbar) \left. \inv{i v} e^{i p v} \right\vert_{p=-R}^R \\
&= \int dv \psi(x - v\hbar) \frac{\sin(R v)}{\pi v} \\
\end{align*}

In a hand-waving (aka. Engineering) fashion, one can identify the limit of $\sin(Rv)/\pi v$ as the dirac delta function and
then declare that this does in fact recover the value of $\psi(x)$ by a Dirac delta filtering around the point $v=0$.

This does in fact work out, but as a strict integration exersize one ought to be able to do better.
Observe that the integral performed here wasn't really valid for $v=0$ in which case the exponential takes the value of one, so it would be
better to treat the neighbourhood of $v=0$ more carefully.  Doing so

\begin{align*}
\inv{{2\pi}} \int dv \psi(x -v\hbar) \int_{-R}^R e^{i p v} dp 
&= \int_{v=-\infty}^{-\epsilon} dv \psi(x - v\hbar) \frac{\sin(R v)}{\pi v} \\
&+ \int_{v=\epsilon}^\infty dv \psi(x - v\hbar) \frac{\sin(R v)}{\pi v} \\
&+ \inv{{2\pi}} \int_{v=-\epsilon}^\epsilon dv \psi(x - v\hbar) \int_{-R}^R e^{i p v} dp \\
&= \int_{v=\epsilon}^\infty dv \left( \psi(x - v\hbar) +\psi(x + v\hbar) \right) \frac{\sin(R v)}{\pi v} \\
&+ \inv{{2\pi}} \int_{v=-\epsilon}^\epsilon dv \psi(x - v\hbar) \int_{-R}^R e^{i p v} dp \\
\end{align*}

Now, evaluating this with $\epsilon$ allowing to tend to zero and $R$ tending to infinity simultaneously is troublesome seeming.  I seem to recall that one
can do something to the effect of setting $\epsilon=1/R$, and then carefully take the limit, but it isn't obvious to me how exactly to do this without
pulling out an old text.
While some kind of ad-hoc limit process can likely be done and justified in some fashion, one can see why the hard core mathematicians had to invent
an alternate stricter mathematics to deal with this stuff rigourously.

That said, from an intuitive point of view, it is fairly clear that the filtering involved here will recover the average of
$\psi(x)$ in the neighbourhood assuming that it is piecewise continuous:

\begin{align*}
\FF^{-1}(\FF(\psi(x))) &= \inv{2} \left( \psi(x -\epsilon) + \psi(x + \epsilon) \right)
\end{align*}
