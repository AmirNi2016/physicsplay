\section{ Motivation. }

Have now made a few excursions related to the concepts of electrodynamic
field energy and momentum.

In \cite{PJpoynting} the energy density rate and poynting divergence 
relationship was demonstrated using Maxwell's equation.  That was:

\begin{align}
\PD{t}{}\frac{\epsilon_0}{2} \left(\BE^2 + c^2 \BB^2\right) + \spacegrad \cdot \inv{\mu_0}(\BE \cross \BB) &= -\BE \cdot \Bj 
\end{align}

There and in \cite{PJemstresstensor} this was related to the 
energy momentum four vectors

\begin{align}
T(a) &= \frac{\epsilon_0}{2} F a \tilde{F}
\end{align}

as defined
in \cite{doran2003gap}, but the big picture view 
of things was missing.

Later in \cite{PJpoyntingRate} the rate of change of Poynting vector
was calculated, with an additional attempt to relate this to $T(\gamma_\mu)$.

These relationships, and the operations required to factoring out the divergence were considerably messier.

Finally, in \cite{PJelectricFieldEnergy} the four vector $T(\gamma_\mu)$
was related to the Lorentz force and the work done moving a charge against
a field.  This provides the natural context for the energy momentum tensor, 
since it appears that the spacetime divergence of each of the
$T(\gamma_\mu)$ four vectors appears to be a component of the
four vector Lorentz force (density).  

In these notes the divergences will be calculated to confirm the
connection between the Lorentz force and energy momentum tensor directly.
This is actually expected to be simpler than the previous calculations.

%It is also 
%potentially of interest, as shown in \cite{PJFourierVacuum}, and
%\cite{PJplaneWave}
%that the energy density and Poynting vectors, and energy momentum four vector,
%were seen to be naturally expressable as Hermitian conjugate operations
%
%\begin{align}
%F^\dagger &= \gamma_0 \tilde{F} \gamma_0
%\end{align}
%\begin{align}
%T(\gamma_0) &= \frac{\epsilon_0}{2} F F^\dagger \gamma_0
%\end{align}
%\begin{align}
%U &= T(\gamma_0) \cdot \gamma_0 = \frac{\epsilon_0}{4} \left(F F^\dagger + F^\dagger F \right) \\
%\BP &= T(\gamma_0) \wedge \gamma_0 = \frac{\epsilon_0}{4} \left(F F^\dagger - F^\dagger F \right)
%\end{align}
%
%It is concievable that a generalization of Hermitian conjugation, where the spatial basis vectors are used instead of $\gamma_0$, will 
%provide a mapping and driving structure from the Four vector quantities and the somewhat scrambled seeming set
%of relationships observed in the split spatial and time domain.  That will also be explored here.

\section{ Spacetime divergence of the energy momentum four vectors. }

The spacetime divergence of the field energy momentum four vector $T(\gamma_0)$ has been calculated previously.  Let's redo this 
calculation for the other components.

\begin{align*}
\grad \cdot T(\gamma_\mu) 
&= \frac{\epsilon_0}{2} \gpgradezero{ \grad (F \gamma_\mu \tilde{F}) } \\
&= \frac{\epsilon_0}{2} \gpgradezero{ (\grad F) \gamma_\mu \tilde{F} + (\tilde{F} \grad) F \gamma_\mu } \\
&= \frac{\epsilon_0}{2} \gpgradezero{ (\grad F) \gamma_\mu \tilde{F} + \gamma_\mu \tilde{F} (\grad F) } \\
&= {\epsilon_0} \gpgradezero{ (\grad F) \gamma_\mu \tilde{F} } \\
&= \inv{c} \gpgradezero{ J \gamma_\mu \tilde{F} } \\
\end{align*}

The ability to perform cyclic reordering of terms in a scalar product has been used above.  Application of one more
reverse operation (which doesn't change a scalar), gives us

\begin{align}
\grad \cdot T(\gamma_\mu) &= \inv{c} \gpgradezero{ F \gamma_\mu J } 
\end{align}

Let's expand the right hand size first.

\begin{align*}
\inv{c} \gpgradezero{ F \gamma_\mu J } &= \inv{c} \gpgradezero{ (\BE + i c \BB) \gamma_\mu (c \rho \gamma_0 + \Bj \gamma_0) } 
\end{align*}

The $\mu = 0$ term looks the easiest, and for that one we have

\begin{align*}
\inv{c} \gpgradezero{ (\BE + i c \BB) (c \rho - \Bj) }  = -\Bj \cdot \BE
\end{align*}

Now, for the other terms, say $\mu = k$, we have

\begin{align*}
\inv{c} \gpgradezero{ (\BE + i c \BB) (c \rho \sigma_k - \sigma_k \Bj ) } 
&= E^k \rho - \gpgradezero{ i \BB \sigma_k \Bj }  \\
&= E^k \rho - J^a B^b \gpgradezero{ \sigma_1 \sigma_2 \sigma_3 \sigma_b \sigma_k \sigma_a }  \\
&= E^k \rho - J^a B^b \epsilon_{a k b} \\
&= E^k \rho + J^a B^b \epsilon_{k a b} \\
&= (\rho \BE + \Bj \cross \BB) \cdot \sigma_k
\end{align*}

Summarizing the two results we have

\begin{align}
\inv{c} \gpgradezero{ F \gamma_0 J } &= -\Bj \cdot \BE \\
\inv{c} \gpgradezero{ F \gamma_k J } &= (\rho \BE + \Bj \cross \BB) \cdot \sigma_k
\end{align}

The second of these is easily recognizable as components of the Lorentz force for an element of charge (density).  The first
of these is actually the energy component of the four vector Lorentz force, so expanding that in terms of spacetime quantities
is the next order of business.

\section{ Four vector Lorentz Force. }

The Lorentz force in covariant form is

%\begin{align}
%m \ddot{x}_\mu &= q F_{} \cdot \frac{dx}{d\tau}
%\end{align}
%
%Or in vector/bivector form

\begin{align}
m \ddot{x} &= q F \cdot \dot{x}/c
\end{align}

Two verifications of this are in order.  One is that we get the traditional vector form of the Lorentz force equation from
this and the other is that we can get the traditional tensor form from this equation.

\subsection{ Lorentz force in tensor form. }

Recovering the tensor form is probably the easier of the two operations.  We have

\begin{align*}
m \ddot{x}_\mu \gamma^\mu
&= \frac{q}{2} F_{\alpha\beta} \dot{x}_\sigma (\gamma^{\alpha} \wedge \gamma^\beta) \cdot \gamma^\sigma \\
&= \frac{q}{2} F_{\alpha\beta} \dot{x}^\sigma (\gamma^{\alpha} {\delta^\beta}_\sigma -\gamma^{\beta} {\delta^\alpha}_\sigma ) \\
&= \frac{q}{2} F_{\alpha\beta} \dot{x}^\beta \gamma^{\alpha} - \frac{q}{2} F_{\alpha\beta} \dot{x}^\alpha \gamma^{\beta} \\
\end{align*}

Dotting with $\gamma_\mu$ the right hand side is

\begin{align*}
\frac{q}{2} F_{\mu\beta} \dot{x}^\beta - \frac{q}{2} F_{\alpha\mu} \dot{x}^\alpha 
&= {q} F_{\mu\alpha} \dot{x}^\alpha 
\end{align*}

Which recovers the tensor form of the equation
\begin{align}
m \ddot{x}_\mu &= {q} F_{\mu\alpha} \dot{x}^\alpha 
\end{align}

\subsection{ Lorentz force components in vector form. }

\begin{align*}
m \gamma \frac{d}{dt} \gamma \left(c + \sigma_k \frac{dx^k}{dt}\right) \gamma_0
&= \frac{q}{2c}(F v - v F) \\
&=
\frac{q \gamma}{2c} 
(\BE + i c\BB) 
\left(c + \sigma_k \frac{dx^k}{dt}\right) \gamma_0
\\
&\quad -
\frac{q \gamma}{2c} 
\left(c + \sigma_k \frac{dx^k}{dt}\right) \gamma_0
(\BE + i c\BB) \\
\end{align*}

Right multiplication by $\gamma_0/\gamma$ we have
\begin{align*}
m \frac{d}{dt} \gamma \left(c + \Bv \right) 
&= \frac{q }{2c} \left( (\BE + i c\BB) \left(c + \Bv \right) -\left(c + \Bv \right) (-\BE + i c\BB) \right) \\
&= \frac{q }{2c} \left( 
%(\BE + i c\BB) (c + \Bv ) 
%-(c + \Bv ) (-\BE + i c\BB) 
+ 2 \BE c 
+ \BE \Bv  + \Bv \BE 
+ i c (\BB \Bv  - \Bv \BB)
\right) \\
\end{align*}

After a last bit of reduction this is
\begin{align}
m \frac{d}{dt} \gamma \left(c + \Bv \right) &= q (\BE + \Bv \cross \BB) + q \BE \cdot \Bv/c
\end{align}

In terms of four vector momentum this is
\begin{align}\label{eqn:lorentzForceVec}
\dot{p} = q ( \BE \cdot \Bv/c + \BE + \Bv \cross \BB ) \gamma_0
\end{align}

\subsection{ Relation to the energy momentum tensor. }

It appears that to relate the energy momentum tensor to the Lorentz force we have 
to work with the upper index quantities rather than the lower index stress tensor vectors.  Doing so
our four vector force per unit volume is
 
\begin{align}
\PD{V}{\dot{p}}
&= (\Bj \cdot \BE + \rho \BE + \Bj \cross \BB) \gamma_0 \\
&= - \inv{c} \left(\gpgradezero{ F \gamma^0 J } \gamma_0 + \gpgradezero{ F \gamma^k J } \gamma_k \right) \\
&= - T(\gamma^\mu) \gamma_\mu
\end{align}

%\section{ Conjugation? }
%% from planewave.ltx
%\subsection{ Followup: energy momentum tensor. }
%
%This also suggests a relativistic generalization of conjugation, since the time basis vector should perhaps not have
%a distinguishing role.  Something like this:
%
%\begin{align*}
%F^{\dagger_\mu} &= \gamma_\mu \tilde{F} \gamma_\mu
%\end{align*}
%
%Or perhaps:
%\begin{align*}
%F^{\dagger_\mu} &= \gamma_\mu \tilde{F} \gamma^\mu
%\end{align*}
%
%may make sense for consideration of the other components of the general energy momentum tensor, which had roughly the form:
%
%\begin{align*}
%T^{\mu\nu} \propto T(\gamma_\mu) \cdot \gamma^\nu
%\end{align*}
%
%(with some probable adjustments to index positions).  Think this through later.
