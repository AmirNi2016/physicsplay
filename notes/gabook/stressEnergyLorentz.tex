\section{ Motivation. }

Have now made a few excursions related to the concepts of electrodynamic
field energy and momentum.

In \cite{PJpoynting} the energy density rate and poynting divergence 
relationship was demonstrated using Maxwell's equation.

In the above and in \cite{PJemstresstensor} this was related to the 
stress energy four vectors

\begin{align}
T(\gamma_\mu) &= \frac{\epsilon_0}{2} F \gamma_0 \tilde{F}
\end{align}

as defined
in \cite{doran2003gap}, but the big picture view 
of things was missing.

Later in \cite{PJpoyntingRate} the rate of change of Poynting vector
was calculated, with an additional attempt to relate this to $T(\gamma_\mu)$.

Finally, in \cite{PJelectricFieldEnergy} the four vector $T(\gamma_\mu)$
was related to the Lorentz force and the work done moving a charge against
a field.  This provides the natural context for the stress energy tensor, 
since it appears that the spacetime divergence of each of the
$T(\gamma_\mu)$ four vectors appears to be a component of the
four vector Lorentz force (density).  

In these notes the divergences will be calculated to confirm the
connection between the Lorentz force and stress energy tensor directly.
This is actually expected to be simpler than the previous calculations.

It is also 
potentially of interest, as shown in \cite{PJFourierVacuum}, and
\cite{PJplaneWave}
that the energy density and Poynting vectors, and energy momentum four vector,
were seen to be naturally expressable as Hermitian conjugate operations

\begin{align}
F^\dagger &= \gamma_0 \tilde{F} \gamma_0
\end{align}
\begin{align}
T(\gamma_0) &= \frac{\epsilon_0}{2} F F^\dagger \gamma_0
\end{align}
\begin{align}
U &= T(\gamma_0) \cdot \gamma_0 = \frac{\epsilon_0}{4} \left(F F^\dagger + F^\dagger F \right) \\
\BP &= T(\gamma_0) \wedge \gamma_0 = \frac{\epsilon_0}{4} \left(F F^\dagger - F^\dagger F \right)
\end{align}

It is concievable that a generalization of Hermitian conjugation, where the spatial basis vectors are used instead of $\gamma_0$, will 
provide a mapping and driving structure from the Four vector quantities and the somewhat scrambled seeming set
of relationships observed in the split spatial and time domain.  That will also be explored here.

\subsection{ Followup: stress energy tensor. }

This also suggests a relativistic generalization of conjugation, since the time basis vector should perhaps not have
a distinguishing role.  Something like this:

\begin{align*}
F^{\dagger_\mu} &= \gamma_\mu \tilde{F} \gamma_\mu
\end{align*}

Or perhaps:
\begin{align*}
F^{\dagger_\mu} &= \gamma_\mu \tilde{F} \gamma^\mu
\end{align*}

may make sense for consideration of the other components of the general stress energy tensor, which had roughly the form:

\begin{align*}
T^{\mu\nu} \propto T(\gamma_\mu) \cdot \gamma^\nu
\end{align*}

(with some probable adjustments to index positions).  Think this through later.
