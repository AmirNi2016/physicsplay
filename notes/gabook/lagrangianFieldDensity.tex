\section{ Evaluating Lagragian equations. }

We have seen previously that the Lagrangian equations expressed in vector 
form can be written

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:lagrangian}
\grad \LL = \frac{d}{d\tau} \grad_v \LL
\end{equation}

There is a constant (at least sign) in the Lagrangian that I am not sure of
at the moment, so the exersize becomes to recover the field equation 
given a Lagrangian of the form

\begin{equation*}
\LL = \kappa \gpgradezero{ (\grad \wedge A)^2 } + J \cdot A
\end{equation*}

and determine the constant factor $\kappa$.  Splitting the Lagrangian temporarily as

\begin{equation*}
\LL = \LL_1 + \LL_2
\end{equation*}

the easy part of this evaluation is application of equation \ref{eqn:lagrangian} to $\LL_2 = J \cdot A$

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:maybewrong}
\grad \LL_2 = J (\grad \cdot A) = \frac{d}{d\tau} \grad_v \LL_2
\end{equation}

Therefore the expectation is that evaluation of the equations on $\LL_2$ will 
result in:

\begin{align*}
\grad \LL_1 
&= \kappa \grad \gpgradezero{ (\grad \wedge A)^2 } \\
&\propto (\grad (\grad \wedge A)) (\grad \cdot A)
\end{align*}

So, the some algebra to fill in the middle steps is required.  My
first attempt to do so has been unsuccessful, so perhaps I'll fall back
to components and give it a try that way first (or try that with $A = \phi \gamma_0$ perhaps as a simple case).

\section{ In coordinates. }

Is equation \ref{eqn:maybewrong} correct?  Let's try the complete Lagrangian calculation in coordinates instead (adding an extra factor of $1/2$
having tried some of this on paper).

\begin{equation*}
\LL = \frac{\kappa}{4} ( \partial_{\mu} A_{\nu} - \partial_{\nu} A_{\mu} ) ( \partial^{\mu} A^{\nu} - \partial^{\nu} A^{\mu} ) + J_{\alpha} A^{\alpha}
\end{equation*}
