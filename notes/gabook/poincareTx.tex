\section{Motivation}

In \cite{montesinos2006sem} a Poincare transformation is used to 
develop the symmetric stress energy tensor directly, in contrast to the
non-symmetric canonical stress energy tensor that results from 
spacetime translation.

Attempt to decode some bits of this article.

\section{Guts}

Equation (11) in the article, is labelled an infinitesimal Poincare
transformation

\begin{align}\label{eqn:txComponents}
{x'}^\mu
&=
{x'}^\mu
+ {{\epsilon}^\mu}_\nu x^\nu
+ {\epsilon}^\mu
\end{align}

It is stated that an antisymmetrization conditon $\epsilon_{\mu\nu} = \epsilon_{\nu\mu}$.  This is somewhat confusing 
since the infinitesimal transformation is given by a mixed upper and lower index tensor.   Due to the antisymmetry
perhaps this all a coordinate statement of the following vector to vector linear transformation

\begin{align}\label{eqn:blah}
x' = x + \epsilon + A \cdot x
\end{align}

This transformation is less restricted than a plain old spacetime transformation, as it also contains a projective term, where $x$ is projected onto the spacetime (or spatial) plane $A$ (a bivector), plus a rotation in that plane.

Writing as usual

\begin{align*}
x = \gamma_\mu x^\mu
\end{align*}

So that components are recovered by taking dot products, as in
\begin{align*}
x^\mu = x \cdot \gamma^\mu
\end{align*}

For the bivector term, write

\begin{align*}
A = c \wedge d = c^\alpha d^\beta (\gamma_\alpha \wedge \gamma_\beta)
\end{align*}

For
\begin{align*}
(A \cdot x ) \cdot \gamma^\mu 
&=
c^\alpha d^\beta x_\sigma ((\gamma_\alpha \wedge \gamma_\beta) \cdot \gamma^\sigma) \cdot \gamma^\mu \\
&=
c^\alpha d^\beta x_\sigma ( {\delta_\alpha}^\mu {\delta_\beta}^\sigma -{\delta_\beta}^\mu {\delta_\alpha}^\sigma ) \\
&=
(c^\mu d^\sigma -c^\sigma d^\mu ) x_\sigma 
\end{align*}

This allows for an identification $\epsilon^\mu\sigma = c^\mu d^\sigma -c^\sigma d^\mu$ which is antisymmetric as required.
With that identification we can write (\ref{eqn:txComponents}) via the equivalent vector relation (\ref{eqn:blah}) if
we write

\begin{align*}
{\epsilon^\mu}_\sigma x^\sigma = (c^\mu d_\sigma -c_\sigma d^\mu ) x^\sigma 
\end{align*}

Where ${\epsilon^\mu}_\sigma$ is defined implicitly in terms of components of the bivector $A = c \wedge d$.

Is this what a Poincare transformation is?  The \href{http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PoincareTransformation.html}{Poincare Transformation} article suggests not.  This article suggests that the Poincare transformation is a spacetime translation plus
a Lorentz tranformation (composition of boosts and rotations).  That Lorentz transformation will not be antisymmetric
however, so how can these be reconciled?  The key is probably the fact that this was an infinistesimal Poincare transformation
so lets consider a Taylor expansion of the Lorentz boost or rotation rotor, considering instead a tranformation of the 
following form

\begin{align}\label{eqn:foo}
x' &= x + \epsilon + R x \tilde{R} \\
R \tilde{R} &= 1
\end{align}

In particular, let's look at the Lorentz transformation in terms of the exponential form
\begin{align*}
R = e^{I \theta/2}
\end{align*}

Here $\theta$ is either the angle of rotation (when the bivector is a unit spatial plane such as $I = \gamma_k \wedge \gamma_m$), or a rapidity angle (when the bivector is a unit spacetime plane such as $I = \gamma_k \wedge \gamma_0$).

Ignoring the translation in (\ref{eqn:foo}) for now, to calculate the first order term in Taylor series we need

\begin{align*}
\frac{dx'}{d\theta} 
&= 
\frac{dR}{d\theta}  x \tilde{R} 
+
{R} x \frac{d\tilde{R}}{d\theta}  
\\
&= 
\frac{dR}{d\theta} \tilde{R} R x \tilde{R} 
+
{R} x \tilde{R} R \frac{d\tilde{R}}{d\theta}  
\\
&=
\inv{2} ( \Omega x' + x' \tilde{\Omega} ) \\
\end{align*}

where 
\begin{align*}
\inv{2}\Omega = \frac{dR}{d\theta} \tilde{R} 
\end{align*}

Now, what is the grade of the product $\Omega$?  We have both $dR/d\theta$ and $R$ in 
$\{\bigwedge^0 \oplus \bigwedge^2\}$
so the product can only have even grades $\Omega \in \{\bigwedge^0 \oplus \bigwedge^2 \oplus \bigwedge^4\}$, but the 
unitary constraint on $R$ restricts this

Since $R \tilde{R} = 1$ the derivative of this is zero

\begin{align*}
\frac{dR}{d\theta} \tilde{R} + {R} \frac{d\tilde{R}}{d\theta}  = 0
\end{align*}

Or
\begin{align*}
\frac{dR}{d\theta} \tilde{R} = - \left( \frac{dR}{d\theta} \tilde{R} \right)^{\tilde{}}
\end{align*}

Antisymmetry rules out grade zero and four terms, leaving only the possibility of grade 2.  That leaves

\begin{align*}
\frac{dx'}{d\theta} = \inv{2}(\Omega x' - x' \Omega) = \Omega \cdot x'
\end{align*}

And the first order Taylor expansion around $\theta =0$ is

\begin{align*}
x'(d\theta) 
&\approx x'(\theta = 0) + ( \Omega d\theta ) \cdot x'
&= x + ( \Omega d\theta ) \cdot x'
\end{align*}

This has close to the postuated form in (\ref{eqn:blah}), but differs in one notable way.  The dot product with the antisymmetric form $A = \inv{2} \frac{dR}{d\theta} \tilde{R} d\theta$ is a dot product with $x'$ and not $x$!  One can however 
invert the identity writing $x$ in terms of $x'$ (to first order)

\begin{align*}
x = x' - ( \Omega d\theta ) \cdot x'
\end{align*}

Replaying this argument in fast forward for the inverse transformation should give us a relation for $x'$ in terms of $x$
and the incremental Lorentz transform

\begin{align*}
x' &= R x \tilde{R} \\
\implies \\
x &= \tilde{R} x' {R} \\
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
\frac{dx}{d\theta}
&= \frac{d \tilde{R}}{d\theta} R \tilde{R} x' R + \tilde{R} x' R \tilde{R} \frac{d {R}}{d\theta}  \\
&= (2 \frac{d \tilde{R}}{d\theta} R ) \cdot x
\end{align*}

So we have the incremental change

\begin{align*}
x'= x - \left(2 \frac{d \tilde{R}}{d\theta} R d\theta \right) \cdot x
\end{align*}
