\section{Motivation}

The problem of a solving for the relativistically correct tragectories of classically interacting proton and electron is one that I've wanted to try for a while.  Conceptually this is just about the simplest interaction problem, but how do we even set up the right equations to solve?

\section{With only Coulomb interaction.}

With just Coulomb (non-relativistic) interaction setup of the equations of motion for the relative vector difference between the particles is straightforward.  Let's write this out as a reference.  Whatever we come up with for the relativistic case should reduce to this at small velocities.

Fixing notation, lets write the proton and electron positions respectively by $\Br_p$ and $\Br_e$, the proton charge as $Z e$, and the electron charge $-e$.  For the forces we have

FIXME: picture

\begin{align}\label{eqn:nuclearInteraction:hoo1}
\text{Force on electron} &= m_e \frac{d^2 \Br_e}{dt^2} = - k Z e^2 \frac{\Br_e - \Br_p}{\Abs{\Br_e - \Br_p}^3} \\
\text{Force on proton} &= m_p \frac{d^2 \Br_p}{dt^2} = k Z e^2 \frac{\Br_e - \Br_p}{\Abs{\Br_e - \Br_p}^3}
\end{align}

Subtracting the two after mass division yields the reduced mass equation for the relative motion

\begin{align}\label{eqn:nuclearInteraction:hoo2}
\frac{d^2 (\Br_e -\Br_p)}{dt^2} = - k Z e^2 \left( \inv{m_e} + \inv{m_p}\right) \frac{\Br_e - \Br_p}{\Abs{\Br_e - \Br_p}^3} 
\end{align}
