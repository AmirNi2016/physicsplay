\section{ Algebraic description of oriented boundaries. }

Having used pictorial methods to enumerate the bounding loop and area elements 
\href{http://www.geocities.com/peeter_joot/geometric_algebra/vector_integral_relations.pdf}{
in the previous derivation} of the vector and bivector forms of Stokes's, makes the application
of these formulas harder.  Here this will be revisited, with the aim of remedying this, as well as
obtaining a proof for the general case, which was not possible because of a lack of exactly this
algebraic formulation.
