In Bohm's QT (\cite{bohm1989qt}, 14.17), the properties of $l=1$ associated Legendre polynomials are examined under rotation.

Those eigenfunctions are the normalized versions of following

\begin{align}\label{eqn:foo1}
\psi_1 &= \sin\theta e^{i\phi} \\
\psi_0 &= \cos\theta \\
\psi_{-1} &= \sin\theta e^{-i\phi}
\end{align}

The normalization is provided by a surface area inner product

\begin{align}\label{eqn:foo2}
(u,v) &= \int_{\theta=0}^{\pi} \int_{\phi=0}^{2\pi} u v^\conj \sin\theta d\theta d\phi
\end{align}

With the normalization discarded, there is a direct relationship between these normal eigenfunctions with a triple of vectors associated with a point on the unit sphere.  Refering to figure (\ref{fig:L1Associated}), observe the three doubled arrow vectors, all associated with a point on the unit sphere $\Bx = (x,y,z) = (\sin\theta \cos\phi, \sin\theta \cos\phi, \cos\theta)$.  

\begin{figure}[htp]

\caption{Vectorizing the $l=1$ associated Legendre polynomials.}\label{fig:L1Associated}
\end{figure}

The normal to the $x-y$ plane from $\Bx$, designated $\Bn$ has the vectorial value

\begin{align}\label{eqn:foo3}
\Bn = \cos\theta \Be_3 
\end{align}

From the origin to the point of of the $x-y$ plane intersection to the normal we have

\begin{align}\label{eqn:foo4}
\Brho = \sin\theta (\cos\phi \Be_1 + \sin\phi \Be_2) = \Be_1 \sin\theta e^{\Be_1 \Be_2 \phi}
\end{align}

and finally for the perpendicular to $\Brho$ in the plane we have the last of this normal triplet

\begin{align}\label{eqn:foo5}
\Brho_{-} = \sin\theta (\cos\phi \Be_1 - \sin\phi \Be_2) = \Be_1 \sin\theta e^{-\Be_1 \Be_2 \phi}
\end{align}

So, if we choose to use $i=\Be_1 \Be_2$ (the bivector for the plane normal to the z-axis), then we can in fact vectorize these eigenfunctions.  The vectors $\Brho$ (i.e. $\psi_1)$, and $\Brho_{-}$ (i.e. $\psi_{-1}$) are both normal to $\Bn$ (i.e. $\psi_0$), but while the vectors $\Brho$ and $\Brho_{-}$ are both in the plane one is produced with a counterclockwise rotation of $\Be_1$ by $\phi$ in the plane and the other with an opposing rotation.

Summarizing, we can write the unnormalized vectors the relations

\begin{equation*}\label{eqn:foo7}
\begin{array}{l l l}
\Brho &= \Be_1 \psi_1 &= \sin\theta e^{\Be_1\Be_2 \phi} = \sin\theta (\cos\phi \Be_1 + \sin\phi \Be_2) \\
\Bn &= \Be_3 \psi_0 &= \cos\theta \Be_3 \\
\Brho_{-} &= \Be_1 \psi_{-1} &= \sin\theta e^{-\Be_1\Be_2 \phi} = \sin\theta (\cos\phi \Be_1 - \sin\phi \Be_2)
\end{array}
\end{equation*}

I have no familiarity yet with the $l=2$ or higher Legendre eigenfunctions.  Do they also admit a geometric representation?
