\section{An examination of the relativistic Doppler formula.}

It was possible to derive the Lorentz boost matrix by requiring that the wave equation operator

\begin{align}
\grad^2 = \inv{c^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} - \spacegrad^2
\end{align}

retain its form under linear transformation (\cite{PJLorentzWave}).  Applying spatial Fourier transforms (\cite{PJwaveFourier}), one finds that solutions to the wave equation 

\begin{align}
\grad^2 \psi(t,\Bx) = 0
\end{align}

Have the form

\begin{align}
\psi(t, \Bx) = \int A(\Bk) e^{i(\Bk \cdot \Bx - \omega t)} d^3 k
\end{align}

Provided that $\omega = \pm c \Abs{\Bk}$.  Wave equation solutions can therefore be thought of as continuously weighted superpositions of constrained fundamental solutions

\begin{align}
\psi_\omega &= e^{i(\Bk \cdot \Bx - \omega t)} \\
c^2 \Bk^2 &= \omega^2
\end{align}

The constraint on frequency and wave number has the look of a Lorentz square

\begin{align}
\omega^2 - c^2 \Bk^2 = 0
\end{align}

Which suggests that in additional to the spacetime vector

\begin{align}
X = (ct, \Bx) = x^\mu \gamma_\mu
\end{align}

evident in the wave equation fundamental solution, we also have a frequency-wavenumber four vector

\begin{align}
\Omega = (\omega/c, \Bk) = k^\mu \gamma_\mu
\end{align}

The pair of four vectors above allow the fundamental solutions to be put explcitily into covariant form

\begin{align}
\Omega \cdot X = \omega t - \Bk \cdot \Bx = k_\mu x^\mu
\end{align}

\begin{align}
\psi_\omega = e^{-i \Omega \cdot X}
\end{align}

Let's also examine the tranformation properties of this fundamental solution, and see as a side effect that $\Omega$
has transforms appropriately as a four vector.
