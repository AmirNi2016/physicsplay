Conversion Steps:

   - run from source dir (edit dir first if req.)

   ~/bin/movetex

   - run:

    ~/bin/filtertex

   - deal with local macros and commands.
   - deal with local eqn:'s.
   - Add to Makefile, main.tex, and METADATA
   - convert internal citations to chapter references.

      %s/cite{/ref{chap:/cg

   - symlink figures :     grep includegraphics XX.tex

   - remove references from ../geometric-algebra/Makefile
   - remove references from webpages.

TODO:

- new Docs to incorporate:

   > Page 41, the second identity that you present doesn't seem correct to me. I think the signs of the right hand side should be reversed. If I am wrong, can you give a reason why?

   blogit/dotBlade.tex        # complete and posted.  Incorporate into 

      >> For page 41, does the following answer your question:

      http://peeterjoot.wordpress.com/2009/08/11/dot-product-of-vector-and-bivector/

      (you can reply there with comments using $latex ... $ so it may be
      easier to discuss in blog comments than in email).

maxwell/maxwellHomoFirstOrder.ltx   # sampled from.  now hacked up.
maxwell/radiationGeometry.ltx       # working.  can't figure out how to complete
qm/L1Associated.ltx                 # posted.  Not too much of interest.  Perhaps put in ../nonga.

DEFECTS:

(Scott).    

- Section 3.2.9. This is more of a comment. The commuting of the geometric product in the second line of the equation for A^2 uses the idea that u_hat is in the plane of the bivector, therefore the wedge product is zero. It would be nice if this reasoning were given. In fact, I think it would be very benificial if there were a section near the beginning that pretty much laid out what is possible with the geometric product and when. Maybe a table of sorts with columns signifying that when you fit certain criteria, orthogonal/parallel/in a plane/etc, that various properties like commutation/associativity/etc work. 
 
- Section 3.2.11. It seems more natural to reverse the order of the things shown in this section. i.e. show that y(dot)u^v=0, then do the planar projection.
 
- Page 43, you say that multiplication by e_1 on the right of a vector is called the conjugate, this might be true I don't have any reference for the conventions of vector multiplication by e_1. But, in this situation the quantity that you are multiplying is a complex number not a vector. It seems that it should read, 'multiplication on the right of a complex number is called the conjugate'.

- ../nonga/

self references to fix.

- read of the pdflatex option:

pdflatex --job-name=dog cat.tex

to rename.  Try that in the makefile.

- shorten titles.

- ../nonga/rapidity has bits of GA content but needs cleanup (lut references)

probably other stuff that could also be moved (or removed for that matter).

- some of my topic pages had discussion bits that might be nice to incorporate
  as chapter heading pages.

- gaGradeDotWedge should logically be merged with the other intro page.  Til
  this is attempted leave them both.

  believe the original goal of both was to prove

  a . ( b ^ c ) = a . b c - a . c b

  and I don't think that I did so with either!

- preface material:

Fixup or comment out if not done before next publish.

- to here and ../nonga/

  some of my topic pages had discussion bits that might be nice to incorporate
  as chapter heading pages.
