Steps:

- convert title to chapter
- deal with local macros and commands.
- Add to Makefile gabook.tex
- convert internal citations to chapter references.
- symlink figures :     grep includegraphics XX.tex

- remove references from ../geometric-algebra/Makefile
- remove references from webpages.

- shorten titles.

- take repeated newcommand stuff and move to peeters_macros3.tex

- have dups of the summary of notations used now (and more in docs TODO).
  Put in the beginning or the end.

- ../geometric-algebra/rapidity has bits of GA content but needs cleanup
(lut references)

- convert the remainder of the everything docs after this to monster(s?)
  to get contents pages.

- obliterated a lot of the date stuff when I started converting to book.
  dig those out again (perhaps display for sort purposes, but at least
  retain as comments).

- some of my topic pages had discussion bits that might be nice to incorporate
  as chapter heading pages.

- dumped in:

matrix_of_linear_tx
ga_grade_dot_wedge

in ToIntegrate section.  Comment out or integrate it before next publish.

- preface material:

Each of the individual bits was written for my own benefit, to either
clarify some topic or to explore it.  Even this compilation (I call it
that instead of book due to quality issues) was for my own benefit, so
I can find stuff that I've thought about more easily.

That said, there's enough here that may be of interest to others that
I thought I'd make it accessible.  I know it doesn't stand on its own,
it has duplication and reworking of topics that you wouldn't find in a
polished text, has rigor only as much as I felt like at the time, has
an ambiguous target audience (each part written for me and my level of
understanding at the time of writing), has many questions, likely has
many errors, has horrid grammar and spelling and run on sentances,
is not structured in a
way that somebody completely new to the subject would find consumable,
has prereqs that are missing, and many other faults especially as a
whole.

However, ... if you are trying to work through a text like
Doran/Lasenby's GA for Physicists, that is quite tough due to brevity
and assumed knowledge (at least for computer-programmer
physicist-wantabee's like me), then there may be parts of this
compilation that has value.

I'm open to any comments, questions, suggestions and feedback, even
for small things.  My study is a evenings and weekends activity as I
have time for it, so acting on any comments may not be immediate.
