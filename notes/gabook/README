Conversion Steps:

   - convert title to chapter
   - deal with local macros and commands.
   - Add to Makefile gabook.tex
   - convert internal citations to chapter references.
   - symlink figures :     grep includegraphics XX.tex

   - remove references from ../geometric-algebra/Makefile
   - remove references from webpages.

- shorten titles.

- take repeated newcommand stuff and move to peeters_macros3.tex

- have dups of the summary of notations used now (and more in docs TODO).
  Put in the beginning or the end.

- ../geometric-algebra/rapidity has bits of GA content but needs cleanup
(lut references)

- convert the remainder of the everything docs after this to monster(s?)
  to get contents pages.

- some of my topic pages had discussion bits that might be nice to incorporate
  as chapter heading pages.

- dumped in:

matrix_of_linear_tx
ga_grade_dot_wedge

in ToIntegrate section.  Comment out or integrate it before next publish.

- preface material:
