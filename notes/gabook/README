Steps:

- convert title to chapter

- deal with local macros and commands.

- Add to Makefile gabook.tex

- convert internal citations to chapter references.

- symlink figures
grep includegraphics XX.tex

- remove references from ../geometric-algebra/Makefile

   DONE: google pages for: GA, classical, QM, relativity, general math.
   TODO: E&M !!!

- take any commented out newcommand stuff in individual docs and move
  to gabook.tex

  stuff that's repeated there, move to peeters_macros3.tex

- have dups of the summary of notations used now (and more in docs TODO).
  Put in the beginning or the end.

- ../geometric-algebra/rapidity has bits of GA content but needs cleanup
(lut references)

- convert the remainder of the everything docs after this to monster(s?)
  to get contents pages.

- obliterated a lot of the date stuff when I started converting to book.
  dig those out again (perhaps display for sort purposes, but at least
  retain as comments).
