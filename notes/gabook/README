Conversion Steps:

   - run from source dir (edit dir first if req.)

   ~/bin/movetex

#   - run:
#
#    ~/bin/filtertex

   - deal with local macros and commands.

   - deal with local eqn:'s. (should be less to do for this since I'm modifying
     ../t/ with the current working file).

   - Edit Makefile, main.tex, and METADATA to put the added stuff in the
      right places.

   - convert internal citations to chapter references.

#      %s/cite{/ref{chap:/cg
      %s/\cite{\\chapcite{/cg

      (shouldn't have to for many future versions).  Done in gabook and nonga.

# movebin now does.
#   - symlink figures :     grep includegraphics XX.tex

   - remove references from ../geometric-algebra/Makefile
   - remove references from webpages.

TODO:

Have hacked eliblog more and this now includes some of that.  Should 
create my own book and blog classes properly.

TODO:

would be nice to convert remaining external citep's to my own stuff to chapter references within current doc aggreggations where appropriate.

   > Page 41, the second identity that you present doesn't seem correct to me. I think the signs of the right hand side should be reversed. If I am wrong, can you give a reason why?

DEFECTS (Scott)

- Section 3.2.9.  gaWiki.tex.  Reworked this section slightly based on Scott's feedback.  Include a diagram, then post in blog, email him for comment, and update ga_wiki.pdf on site.  Perhaps address the two other comments below first.
 
- Section 3.2.11. It seems more natural to reverse the order of the things shown in this section. i.e. show that y(dot)u^v=0, then do the planar projection.
 
- Page 43, you say that multiplication by e_1 on the right of a vector is called the conjugate, this might be true I don't have any reference for the conventions of vector multiplication by e_1. But, in this situation the quantity that you are multiplying is a complex number not a vector. It seems that it should read, 'multiplication on the right of a complex number is called the conjugate'.

- ../nonga/

self references to fix.

- read of the pdflatex option:

pdflatex --job-name=dog cat.tex

to rename.  Try that in the makefile.

- shorten titles.

- ../nonga/rapidity has bits of GA content but needs cleanup (lut references)

probably other stuff that could also be moved (or removed for that matter).

- some of my topic pages had discussion bits that might be nice to incorporate
  as chapter heading pages.

- gaGradeDotWedge should logically be merged with the other intro page.  Til
  this is attempted leave them both.

  believe the original goal of both was to prove

  a . ( b ^ c ) = a . b c - a . c b

  and I don't think that I did so with either!

- preface material:

Fixup or comment out if not done before next publish.

- to here and ../nonga/

HAVE NOW DONE THIS FOR MY 2009 DESCRIPTIVE TEXT, and all but the e&m ones of the others.

- Latex notes:

Box:
   \endproof

   creates a black box

Color:

   Both LaTeXMathML and HTML allow the use of color. In LaTeXMathML, non-math text is colored using

   \textcolor{TheColor}{text to be colored}.

   For example, this text is blue and this text is magenta . The background of non-math text is colored using

   \colorbox{TheColor}{text to be background colored}.

   This is sometimes known as Highlighting!

    
   The textcolor and undefined commands can be used inside of equations. Also, the color of an entire equation can be set using the ommand inside the equation. For example, the LaTeX code

   \[ \int \color{#8F001A} _a ^b f^{\prime}(x)\, dx = f(b) - f(a), 
   \qquad \textcolor{pinegreen}{\colorbox{yellow}{FTOC I}} \]

   is rendered as
   abf(x)dx=f(b)-f(a),FTOCI
   A list of allowable color names is included in the appendix. No error checking to insure valid colors is performed. 

bigger space than quad:
