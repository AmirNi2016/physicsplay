Conversion Steps:

   - convert title to chapter
   - run:

    ~/bin/filtertex

   - deal with local macros and commands.
   - deal with local eqn:'s.
   - Add to Makefile main.tex
   - convert internal citations to chapter references.
   - symlink figures :     grep includegraphics XX.tex

   - remove references from ../geometric-algebra/Makefile
   - remove references from webpages.

TODO:
- shorten titles.

- have dups of the summary of notations used now (and more in docs TODO).
  Put in the beginning or the end.

- ../geometric-algebra/rapidity has bits of GA content but needs cleanup
(lut references)

- convert the remainder of the everything docs after this to monster(s?)
  to get contents pages.

- some of my topic pages had discussion bits that might be nice to incorporate
  as chapter heading pages.

- dumped in:

matrix_of_linear_tx
ga_grade_dot_wedge

in ToIntegrate section.  Comment out or integrate it before next publish.

- preface material:

FIXup.

- convert paths from underscores to camel case and add in \date prologue
  like in ../maxwell/stressEnergyTensor.ltx (do this for ../nonga/*tex too).

- to here and ../nonga/

  some of my topic pages had discussion bits that might be nice to incorporate
  as chapter heading pages.
