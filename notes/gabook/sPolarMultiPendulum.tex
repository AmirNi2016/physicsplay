\section{Motivation}

The planar multiple pendulum problem proved somewhat tractable in the Hamiltonian formulation.  Generalizing this to allow for three dimensional motion is a logical next step.  Here this is attempted, using a Geometric Algebra scalar plus bivector parameterization of the spherical position of each dangling mass relative to the position of what it is attached to, as in

\begin{align}\label{eqn:sPolarMultiPendulum:zoo1}
z = r \Be_3 e^{j\theta}
\end{align}

The exponential is essentially a unit quaternion, rotating the vector $r \Be_3$ from the polar axis to its $\theta,\phi$ angle dependent position.  Two sided rotation operators are avoided here by requiring of the unit bivector $j = \Be_3 \wedge \Bm$, where $\Bm$ is a vector in the plane of rotation passing through the great circle from $\Be_3$ through $z$.  Note that we are free to pick $\Bm = \Be_1 e^{\Be_1 \Be_2 \phi}$, the unit vector in the $x,y$ plane at angle $\phi$ from the x-axis.  When that is done $j = \Be_3 \Bm$ since these are perpendicular.  Setting up the Lagrangian in terms of the bivector $j$ instead of the scalar angle $\phi$ will be attempted, since this is expected to have some elegance and will be a fun way to try the problem.  This should also provide a concrete example of a multivector Lagrangian in a context much simpler than electromagnetic fields or quantum mechanics.

Note finally that a number of simplifying assumptions will be made.  These include use of point masses, zero friction at the pivots and rigid nonspringy massless connecting rods between the masses.
