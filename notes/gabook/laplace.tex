\chapter{Exponential Solutions to Laplace Equation in \R{N}}
\label{chap:laplace}
%\date{Feb 28, 2008.  laplace.tex}

\section{The problem}

Want solutions of

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:gaLaplacianSol:laplacian}
\laplacian f = \sum_k \dsqxj{f}{k} = 0
\end{equation}

For real f.

\subsection{One dimension}

Here the problem is easy, just integrate twice:

\[
f = cx + d.
\]

\subsection{Two dimensions}

For the two dimensional case we want to solve:

\[
\dsqxj{f}{1} + \dsqxj{f}{2} = 0
\]

Using separation of variables one can find solutions of the form $f = X(x_1)Y(x_2)$.  Differentiating we have:

\[
X''Y + XY'' = 0
\]

So, for $X \ne 0$, and $Y \ne 0$:
\[
\frac{X''}{X} = -\frac{Y''}{Y} = k^2
\]

\[
\implies
X = e^{kx}
\]
\[
Y = e^{k\Bi y}
\]

\[
\implies
f = XY = e^{k(x + \Bi y)}
\]

Here $\Bi$ is anything that squares to -1.  Traditionally this is the
complex unit imaginary, but we are also free to use a geometric product unit bivector such as $\Bi = \Be_1 \wedge \Be_2 = \Be_1\Be_2 = \Be_{12}$, or $\Bi = \Be_{21}$.

With $\Bi = \Be_{12}$ for example we have:

\begin{align*}
f = XY = e^{k(x + \Bi y)}
&= e^{k(x + \Be_{12} y)} \\
&= e^{k(x\Be_{1}\Be_1 + \Be_{12} y)} \\
&= e^{k\Be_1(x\Be_1 + \Be_2 y)} \\
\end{align*}

Writing $\Bx = \sum x_i \Be_i$, all of the following are solutions
of the Laplacian

\begin{align*}
e^{k\Be_1\Bx} \\
e^{\Bx k\Be_1} \\
e^{k\Be_2\Bx} \\
e^{\Bx k\Be_2} \\
\end{align*}

Now there isn't anything special about the use of the x and y axis so it is reasonable to expect that, given any constant vector $\Bk$,
the following may also be solutions to the two dimensional Laplacian problem

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:gaLaplacianSol:expgeo1}
e^{\Bx\Bk} = e^{\Bx \cdot \Bk + \Bx \wedge \Bk}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:gaLaplacianSol:expgeo2}
e^{\Bk\Bx} = e^{\Bx \cdot \Bk - \Bx \wedge \Bk}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Verifying it's a solution}

To verify that equations \ref{eqn:gaLaplacianSol:expgeo1} and \ref{eqn:gaLaplacianSol:expgeo2} are Laplacian solutions, start with taking the first order partial with one of the coordinates.
Since there are conditions where this form of solution works in \R{N},
a two dimensional Laplacian will not be assumed here.

\[
\dxj{}{j}e^{\Bx\Bk}
\]

This can be evaluated without any restrictions, but introducing the restriction that the bivector part of $\Bx\Bk$
is coplanar with it's derivative simplifies the result considerably.  That is introduce a restriction:

\[
\gpgradetwo{ \Bx \wedge \Bk \dxj{\Bx \wedge \Bk}{j} } = \gpgradetwo{ \Bx \wedge \Bk \Be_j \wedge \Bk } = 0
\]

With such a restriction we have

\[
\dxj{}{j}e^{\Bx\Bk} = \Be_j\Bk e^{\Bx\Bk} = e^{\Bx\Bk} \Be_j\Bk 
\]

Now, how does one enforce a restriction of this form in general?  Some thought will show that one way to do so 
is to require that
both $\Bx$ and $\Bk$ have only two components.  Say, components $j$, and $m$.  Then, summing second partials
we have:

\begin{align*}
\sum_{u=j,m}\dsqxj{}{u}e^{\Bx\Bk}
&= \left( \Be_j\Bk \Be_j\Bk + \Be_m\Bk \Be_m\Bk \right) e^{\Bx\Bk} \\
&= \left( \Be_j\Bk (-\Bk\Be_j + 2 \Bk \cdot \Be_j) + \Be_m\Bk (-\Bk\Be_m + 2 \Be_m \cdot \Bk) \right) e^{\Bx\Bk} \\
&= \left( -2\Bk^2 + 2 k_j^2 + 2 k_m k_j \Be_{jm} + 2 k_m^2 + 2 k_j k_m \Be_{mj} \right) e^{\Bx\Bk} \\
&= \left( -2\Bk^2 + 2 \Bk^2 + 2 k_j k_m (\Be_{mj} + \Be_{jm}) \right) e^{\Bx\Bk} \\
&= 0 \\
\end{align*}

This proves the result, but essentially just says that this form of
solution is only
valid when the constant parametrization vector $\Bk$ and $\Bx$ and its 
variation are restricted to a specific plane.  That result could have
been obtained in much simpler ways, but I learned a lot about bivector
geometry in the approach! (not all listed here since it caused serious
digressions)

\subsection{Solution for an arbitrarily oriented plane}

Because the solution above is coordinate free, one would expect that this
works for any solution that is restricted to the plane with bivector $\Bi$
even when those do not line up with any specific pair of two coordinates.
This can be verified by performing a rotational 
coordinate transformation of the 
Laplacian operator, since one can always pick a pair of mutually orthogonal
basis vectors with corresponding coordinate vectors that lie in the plane
defined by such a bivector.

Given two arbitrary vectors in the space when both are projected onto the plane
with constant bivector $\Bi$ their product is:

\[
\left(\Bx \cdot \Bi \inv{\Bi}\right)\left(\inv{\Bi} \Bi \cdot \Bk\right)
=
(\Bx \cdot \Bi)(\Bk \cdot \Bi)
\]

Thus one can express the general equation for a planar solution to the
homogeneous Laplace equation in the form

\begin{equation}
\exp((\Bx \cdot \Bi)(\Bk \cdot \Bi))
=
\exp((\Bx \cdot \Bi) \cdot (\Bk \cdot \Bi) +
     (\Bx \cdot \Bi) \wedge (\Bk \cdot \Bi) )
\end{equation}

\subsection{Characterization in real numbers}

Now that it has been verified that equations \ref{eqn:gaLaplacianSol:expgeo1} and \ref{eqn:gaLaplacianSol:expgeo2} are solutions
of equation \ref{eqn:gaLaplacianSol:laplacian} let's characterize this in terms of real numbers.

If $\Bx$, and $\Bk$ are colinear, the solution has the form

\begin{equation}
e^{\pm\Bx \cdot \Bk}
\end{equation}

(ie: purely hyperbolic solutions).

Whereas with $\Bx$ and $\Bk$ orthogonal we have can employ the unit bivector for the plane spanned by these vectors
$\Bi = \frac{\Bx \wedge \Bk}{\abs{\Bx \wedge \Bk}}$:

\begin{equation}
e^{\pm\Bx \wedge \Bk} = \cos\abs{\Bx \wedge \Bk} \pm \Bi\sin\abs{\Bx \wedge \Bk}
\end{equation}

Or:
\begin{equation}
e^{\pm\Bx \wedge \Bk} = \cos\left(\frac{\Bx \wedge \Bk}{\Bi}\right) \pm \Bi\sin\left(\frac{\Bx \wedge \Bk}{\Bi}\right)
\end{equation}

(ie: purely trigonometric solutions)

Provided $\Bx$, and $\Bk$ aren't colinear, the wedge product component of the above can be written in terms of a unit bivector
$\Bi = \frac{\Bx \wedge \Bk}{\abs{\Bx \wedge \Bk}}$:

\begin{align*}
e^{\Bx\Bk} &= e^{\Bx \cdot \Bk + \Bx \wedge \Bk} \\
&= e^{\Bx \cdot \Bk} \left( \cos{\abs{\Bx \wedge \Bk}} + \Bi \sin{\abs{\Bx \wedge \Bk}} \right) \\
&= e^{\Bx \cdot \Bk} \left( \cos\left(\frac{\Bx \wedge \Bk}{\Bi}\right) + \Bi \sin\left(\frac{\Bx \wedge \Bk}{\Bi}\right) \right) \\
\end{align*}

And, for the reverse:
\begin{align*}
(e^{\Bx\Bk})^\dagger = e^{\Bk\Bx}
&= e^{\Bx \cdot \Bk} \left( \cos{\abs{\Bx \wedge \Bk}} - \Bi \sin\left(\abs{\Bx \wedge \Bk}\right) \right) \\
&= e^{\Bx \cdot \Bk} \left( \cos\left(\frac{\Bx \wedge \Bk}{\Bi}\right) - \Bi \sin\left(\frac{\Bx \wedge \Bk}{\Bi}\right) \right) \\
\end{align*}

This exponential however has both scalar and bivector parts, and we are looking for a strictly scalar result, so we can use linear combinations of the
exponential and its reverse to form a strictly real sum for the $\Bx \wedge \Bk \ne 0$ cases:

\begin{align*}
\inv{2}\left(e^{\Bx\Bk} + e^{\Bk\Bx}\right) = e^{\Bx\cdot\Bk}\cos\left(\frac{\Bx \wedge \Bk}{\Bi}\right) \\
\inv{2\Bi}\left(e^{\Bx\Bk} - e^{\Bk\Bx}\right) = e^{\Bx\cdot\Bk}\sin{\frac{\Bx \wedge \Bk}{\Bi}} \\
\end{align*}

Also note that further linear combinations (with positive and negative variations of $\Bk$) can be taken, so we can
combine equations \ref{eqn:gaLaplacianSol:expgeo1} and \ref{eqn:gaLaplacianSol:expgeo2} into the following real valued, coordinate free, form:

\begin{align}
\cosh(\Bx\cdot\Bk)\cos\left({\frac{\Bx \wedge \Bk}{\Bi}}\right) \\
\sinh(\Bx\cdot\Bk)\cos\left({\frac{\Bx \wedge \Bk}{\Bi}}\right) \\
\cosh(\Bx\cdot\Bk)\sin\left({\frac{\Bx \wedge \Bk}{\Bi}}\right) \\
\sinh(\Bx\cdot\Bk)\sin\left({\frac{\Bx \wedge \Bk}{\Bi}}\right) 
\end{align}

Observe that the ratio $\frac{\Bx \wedge \Bk}{\Bi}$ is just a scalar 
determinant

\[
\frac{\Bx \wedge \Bk}{\Bi}
=
x_j k_m - x_m k_j
\]

So one is free to choose $k' = k_m \Be_j - k_j \Be_m$, in which case the
solution takes the alternate form:

\begin{align}
\cos(\Bx\cdot\Bk')\cosh\left({\frac{\Bx \wedge \Bk'}{\Bi}}\right) \\
\sin(\Bx\cdot\Bk')\cosh\left({\frac{\Bx \wedge \Bk'}{\Bi}}\right) \\
\cos(\Bx\cdot\Bk')\sinh\left({\frac{\Bx \wedge \Bk'}{\Bi}}\right) \\
\sin(\Bx\cdot\Bk')\sinh\left({\frac{\Bx \wedge \Bk'}{\Bi}}\right) 
\end{align}

These sets of equations and the exponential form both remove the explicit reference to the pair of coordinates used in the original restriction 

\[
\gpgradetwo{ \Bx \wedge \Bk \Be_j \wedge \Bk } = 0
\]

that was used in the proof that $e^{\Bx\Bk}$ was a solution.
