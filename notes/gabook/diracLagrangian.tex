\section{ Dirac Lagrangian with Feynman slash notation. }

Wikipedia's \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian#Dirac_Lagrangian}{Dirac Lagrangian} entry lists the Lagrangian as

\begin{align*}
\LL = \bar \psi (i \hbar c \Dslash - mc^2) \psi
\end{align*}

"where $\psi\!$ is a Dirac spinor, $\bar \psi = \psi^\dagger \gamma^0$ is its Dirac adjoint, $D\!$ is the gauge covariant derivative, and $\Dslash$ is Feynman slash notation|Feynman notation for $\gamma^\sigma D_\sigma\!$."

Let's decode this.  First, what's $D_\sigma$?

From \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_covariant_derivative}{Guage theory}

\begin{align*}
D_\mu := \partial_\mu - i e A_\mu
\end{align*}

where $A_\mu$ is the electromagnetic vector potential.

So, in four-vector notation we have

\begin{align*}
\Dslash 
&= \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu - i e \gamma^\mu A_\mu \\
&= \grad - i e A \\
\end{align*}

So our Lagrangian written out in full is left as

\begin{align}\label{eqn:lag1}
\LL = \psi^\dagger \gamma^0 ( i \hbar c \grad + \hbar c e A - mc^2) \psi
\end{align}

How about this $\gamma^0 i \grad$ term?  If we assume that $i = \gamma_0 \gamma_1 \gamma_2 \gamma_3$ is the four space pseudoscalar, then this is

\begin{align*}
\gamma^0 i \grad
&= - i \gamma^0 (\gamma^0 \partial_0 + \gamma^i \partial_i) \\
&= - i (\partial_0 + \sigma_i \partial_i) \\
\end{align*}

So, operationally, we have the dual of a quaternion like gradient operator.  If $\psi$ is an even grade object, as I'd guess can be implied by
the term spinor, then there is some sense to requiring a gradient operation that has scalar and spacetime bivector components.

Let's write this

\begin{align*}
\gamma^0 \grad &= \partial_0 + \sigma_i \partial_i = {\grad}_{0,2}
\end{align*}

Assuming that $\psi^\dagger$ is equivalent to reverse operation as the notation suggests, and that $\psi$ is even grades.  Then we have $i$ commuting with $\psi$ or its reverse and the Lagrangian is

\begin{align}\label{eqn:lag2}
\LL 
= 
-i \hbar c \psi^\dagger {\grad}_{0,2} \psi
+ \hbar c e \psi^\dagger \gamma^0 A \psi
- m c^2 \psi^\dagger \gamma^0 \psi
\end{align}

\subsection{ Field equations. }

Now, how to recover the field equation from \ref{eqn:lag1} or \ref{eqn:lag2}?  If one assumes that the Euler-Lagrange field equations

\begin{align*}
\PD{\eta}{\LL} - \partial_\mu \PD{(\partial_\mu \eta)}{\LL} = 0
\end{align*}

hold for these even grade field variables $\psi$, then treating $\psi$ and $\psi^\dagger$ as separate field variables one has for the reversed field variable

\begin{align*}
\PD{\psi^\dagger}{\LL} - \partial_\mu \PD{(\partial_\mu \psi^\dagger)}{\LL} &= 0 \\
\gamma^0 ( i \hbar c \grad + \hbar c e A - mc^2) \psi - (0) &= 0
\end{align*}

Or 
\begin{align*}
\hbar (i \grad + e A) \psi = mc \psi
\end{align*}

Except for the additional $e A$ term here, this is the Dirac equation that we get from taking square roots of the Klien-Gordon equation.  Should $A$ be considered a field variable?  More likely is that this is a supplied potential as in the $V$ of the non-relativistic 
Schr\"{o}dinger's equation.

Being so loose with the math here is somewhat distrubing but developing some intuition is worthwhile before getting the details down.

Our Lagrangian isn't at all symmetric looking, at least compared to the Lagrangians for the 
Schr\"{o}dinger's equation, and Klien-Gordon equation respectively

\begin{align*}
\LL = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}
(\spacegrad \psi) \cdot (\spacegrad \psi^\conj) + V \psi \psi^\conj + {i \hbar} \left( \psi \partial_t \psi^\conj - \psi^\conj \partial_t \psi \right)
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
\LL &= -\partial^\nu \psi \partial_\nu \psi^\conj + \frac{m^2 c^2}{\hbar^2} \psi \psi^\conj \\
\end{align*}

So, it is not obvious that we'd get a similarly nice symmetric reversal or conguate result between the two field variables, if we compute
the field equations that result from treating $\psi$ itself as the field variable to differentiate with respect to.  Let's now take
those derivatives to see what follows.

\section{ Alternate Dirac Lagrangian with antisymmetric terms. }

Now, 
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_equation#Adjoint_equation_and_Dirac_current}{Adjoint equation and Dirac current} lists the Lagrangian as

\begin{align*}
\LL = mc \bar{\psi}\psi - {\inv{2}i\hbar}(\bar{\psi}\gamma^\mu (\partial_\mu\psi) - (\partial_\mu\bar{\psi})\gamma^\mu \psi)
\end{align*}
