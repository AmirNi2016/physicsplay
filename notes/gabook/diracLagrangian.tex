\section{ Dirac Lagrangian with Feynman slash notation. }

Wikipedia's \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian#Dirac_Lagrangian}{Dirac Lagrangian} entry lists the Lagrangian as

\begin{align*}
\LL = \bar \psi (i \hbar c \Dslash - mc^2) \psi
\end{align*}

"where $\psi\!$ is a Dirac spinor, $\bar \psi = \psi^\dagger \gamma^0$ is its Dirac adjoint, $D\!$ is the gauge covariant derivative, and $\Dslash$ is Feynman slash notation|Feynman notation for $\gamma^\sigma D_\sigma\!$."

Let's decode this.  First, what's $D_\sigma$?

From \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_covariant_derivative}{Gauge theory}

\begin{align*}
D_\mu := \partial_\mu - i e A_\mu
\end{align*}

where $A_\mu$ is the electromagnetic vector potential.

So, in four-vector notation we have

\begin{align*}
\Dslash 
&= \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu - i e \gamma^\mu A_\mu \\
&= \grad - i e A \\
\end{align*}

So our Lagrangian written out in full is left as

\begin{align}\label{eqn:lag1}
\LL = \psi^\dagger \gamma^0 ( i \hbar c \grad + \hbar c e A - mc^2) \psi
\end{align}

How about this $\gamma^0 i \grad$ term?  If we assume that $i = \gamma_0 \gamma_1 \gamma_2 \gamma_3$ is the four space pseudoscalar, then this is

\begin{align*}
\gamma^0 i \grad
&= - i \gamma^0 (\gamma^0 \partial_0 + \gamma^i \partial_i) \\
&= - i (\partial_0 + \sigma_i \partial_i) \\
\end{align*}

So, operationally, we have the dual of a quaternion like gradient operator.  If $\psi$ is an even grade object, as I'd guess can be implied by
the term spinor, then there is some sense to requiring a gradient operation that has scalar and spacetime bivector components.

Let's write this

\begin{align*}
\gamma^0 \grad &= \partial_0 + \sigma_i \partial_i = {\grad}_{0,2}
\end{align*}

Now, how about the meaning of $\bar\psi = \psi^\dagger \gamma^0$?  I initially assumed that $\psi^\dagger$ was the reverse operation.
However, looking in the quantum treatment of \cite{doran2003gap} and their earlier relativity content, I see that they explicitly avoid dagger as a reverse in a relativistic context since it is used for ``something-else'' in a quantum context.  It appears that their mapping from matrix algebra to clifford 
algebra is 

\begin{align*}
\psi^\dagger \equiv \gamma_0 \tilde{\psi} \gamma_0,
\end{align*}

where tilde is used for the reverse operation.

This then implies that 

\begin{align*}
\bar \psi = \psi^\dagger \gamma^0 = \gamma_0 \tilde{\psi}
\end{align*}

Now, it is somewhat interesting to note that treating $\psi^\dagger$ as a reverse operation resulted, after calculation of the field equations, in the quantity $\gamma_0 \psi^\dagger \gamma_0$ showing up as a significant quanity.  It was almost like the math was auto-correcting itself attempting to show that the this was the real quantity of interest.

Anyways, mistakes aside, we now have an expression of the Lagrangian in full in terms of geometric objects

\begin{align}\label{eqn:lag2}
\LL = \gamma_0 \tilde{\psi} ( i \hbar c \grad + \hbar c e A - mc^2) \psi.
\end{align}

Assuming that this is now the correct geometric interpretation of the Lagrangian, why bother having that first $\gamma_0$ factor.  It shouldn't change the field equations (just as a constant factor shouldn't make a difference).  It seems more natural to instead write the Lagrangian as just

\begin{align}\label{eqn:lag3}
\LL = \tilde{\psi} \left( i \grad + e A - \frac{mc}{\hbar} \right) \psi,
\end{align}

where both the constant vector factor $\gamma_0$, the redundant common factor of $c$ have been removed, and we divide throughout by $\hbar$ to tidy up a bit.  Perhaps this tidy up should be omitted since it sacrifies the 
energy dimensionality of the original.

\subsection{ Field equations. }

Now, how to recover the field equation from \ref{eqn:lag3} 
%or \ref{eqn:lag2}
?  If one assumes that the Euler-Lagrange field equations

\begin{align*}
\PD{\eta}{\LL} - \partial_\mu \PD{(\partial_\mu \eta)}{\LL} = 0
\end{align*}

hold for these even grade field variables $\psi$, then treating $\psi$ and $\bar \psi$ as separate field variables one has for the reversed field variable

\begin{align*}
\PD{\tilde{\psi}}{\LL} - \partial_\mu \PD{(\partial_\mu \tilde{\psi})}{\LL} &= 0 \\
\left( i \grad + e A - \frac{mc}{\hbar}\right) \psi - (0) &= 0
\end{align*}

Or 
\begin{align*}
\hbar (i \grad + e A) \psi = mc \psi
\end{align*}

Except for the additional $e A$ term here, this is the Dirac equation that we get from taking square roots of the Klien-Gordon equation.  Should $A$ be considered a field variable?  More likely is that this is a supplied potential as in the $V$ of the non-relativistic 
Schr\"{o}dinger's equation.

Being so loose with the math here (ie: taking partials with respect to non-scalar variables) is somewhat distrubing but developing some intuition is worthwhile before getting the details down.

\subsection{ Congugate field equation. }

Our Lagrangian isn't at all symmetric looking, at least compared to the Lagrangians for the 
Schr\"{o}dinger's equation, and Klien-Gordon equation respectively, which are

\begin{align}
\LL &= \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}
(\spacegrad \psi) \cdot (\spacegrad \psi^\conj) + V \psi \psi^\conj + {i \hbar} \left( \psi \partial_t \psi^\conj - \psi^\conj \partial_t \psi \right) \\
\LL &= -\partial^\nu \psi \partial_\nu \psi^\conj + \frac{m^2 c^2}{\hbar^2} \psi \psi^\conj.
\end{align}

With these Lagrangians one gets the field equation for $\psi$, differentiating with respect to the conjugate field $\psi^\conj$, and the conjugate equation with differentiation with respect to $\psi$ (where $\psi$ and $\psi^\conj$ are treated as independent field variables).

With such an asymmetric Lagrangian, it is not obvious that we'd get a similarly nice symmetric reversal result with respect to $\psi$ and $\tilde{\psi}$.

Let's compute the derivatives with respect to the $\psi$ field variables to compute the equations for $\bar \psi$ to see what results.  Written out in coordinates so that we can apply the Euler-Lagrange equations, our Lagrangian (with $A$ terms omitted) is

\subsection{ WRONG FROM HERE. Dagger misinterpreted. }

Assuming that $\psi^\dagger$ is equivalent to reverse operation as the notation suggests, and that $\psi$ is even grades.  Then we have $i$ commuting with $\psi$ or its reverse and the Lagrangian is

\begin{align}\label{eqn:lag2busted}
\LL 
= 
-i \hbar c \psi^\dagger {\grad}_{0,2} \psi
+ \hbar c e \psi^\dagger \gamma^0 A \psi
- m c^2 \psi^\dagger \gamma^0 \psi
\end{align}

\subsubsection{ Congugate field equation. WRONG BITS. }

\begin{align}\label{eqn:lagNoA}
\LL = \bar\psi i \hbar c \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \psi - \bar \psi m c^2 \psi
\end{align}

From this we have

\begin{align*}
\PD{\psi}{\LL} = -m c^2 \bar\psi
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
\partial_\mu \PD{(\partial_\mu \psi)}{\LL} 
&= \partial_\mu \bar\psi i \hbar c \gamma^\mu
\end{align*}

With $\bar\psi = \psi^\dagger \gamma^0$, the field equation is

\begin{align*}
\partial_\mu \psi^\dagger \gamma^0 i \hbar c \gamma^\mu = -m c^2 \psi^\dagger \gamma^0
\end{align*}

One can see the gradient hiding in there.  First noting that the pseudoscalar reverses to itself

\begin{align*}
i^\dagger 
&= \gamma_{3210} \\
&= -\gamma_{2103} \\
&= -\gamma_{1023} \\
&= \gamma_{0123} \\
&= i,
\end{align*}

we can reverse all the terms above for

\begin{align*}
\hbar c \gamma^\mu i \gamma^0 \partial_\mu \psi &= -m c^2 \gamma^0 \psi \\
i \hbar c \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \gamma^0 \psi &=
\end{align*}

So, we have the gradient hiding here and the ``conjugate'' field equation isn't for $\psi^\dagger$, or $\bar \psi$, but for ${\bar\psi}^\dagger = \gamma^0 \psi$.  

\begin{align}\label{eqn:antimatter}
i \hbar \grad (\gamma^0 \psi) &= -m c (\gamma^0 \psi)
\end{align}

So, the field variable $\gamma^0 \psi$ we find associated with a negated mass term.  Perhaps this is Dirac's antimatter field equation?

\subsubsection{ Spacetime split of the field equations. }

Unlike the $+m$ field equation

\begin{align}\label{eqn:regularMatter}
i \hbar \grad \psi &= m c \psi
\end{align}

where $\psi$ has been assumed to be even, and likely of the specific form

\begin{align*}
\psi = \alpha + P^i \sigma_i
\end{align*}

WRONG GUESS HERE TOO.  Spinors in Doran/Lasenby appear to use the dual pauli vectors, and not the bivectors themselves.  This actually makes sense since one wants a spatial bivector for spin, and not the spacetime bivector as used in a Lorentz boost.

this field variable isn't a scalar, bivector (quaternion like), but has vector/trivector parts.  With field variables having scalar, bivector, vector and trivector parts it isn't unreasonable to consider a spacetime split.  Observe that we have an almost recognizable term in the effective field variable $\gamma^0 \psi$ of
equation \ref{eqn:antimatter}.  In particular recall that the electric field and magnetic field components of the faraday bivector can be obtained from a 
$\gamma^0 F \gamma_0$ spacetime split.  Specifically

\begin{align*}
F 
&= \BE + i c \BB \\
&= E^j \sigma_j + i c B^j \sigma_j \\
&= E^j \gamma_j \gamma_0 + i c B^j \gamma_j \gamma_0 \\
\end{align*}

With this we have

\begin{align*}
\gamma^0 F \gamma_0
&= E^j \gamma^0 \gamma_j + \gamma^0 i c B^j \gamma_j \\
&= -E^j \sigma_j + i c B^j \sigma_j \\
&= -\BE + i c \BB
\end{align*}

So we have

\begin{align*}
\inv{2} \left(F - \gamma^0 F \gamma_0 \right) &= \BE \\
\inv{2i} \left(F + \gamma^0 F \gamma_0 \right) &= c \BB
\end{align*}

Does it make sense to use such a spacetime split on the field variables of equations \ref{eqn:regularMatter} and \ref{eqn:antimatter}.  The field equations
found from the Lagrangian for these are 

\begin{align*}
i \hbar \grad \psi &= m c \psi \\
i \hbar \grad (\gamma^0 \psi \gamma_0) &= -m c (\gamma^0 \psi \gamma_0)
\end{align*}

Adding and subtracting these we have

\begin{align*}
i \hbar \grad (\psi + \gamma^0 \psi \gamma_0) &= m c (\psi -\gamma^0 \psi \gamma_0) \\
i \hbar \grad (\psi - \gamma^0 \psi \gamma_0) &= m c (\psi +\gamma^0 \psi \gamma_0)
\end{align*}

Here we have a pair of coupled field equations that have a bit more regularity than 
\ref{eqn:regularMatter} and \ref{eqn:antimatter}.  Is there any physical meaning to these?

One last tweak that seems natural is to put these in exactly the form of the electric and magnetic field splits

\begin{align*}
\hbar \grad \inv{2i} (\psi + \gamma^0 \psi \gamma_0) &= m c \inv{2} (\psi -\gamma^0 \psi \gamma_0) \\
\hbar \grad \inv{2} (\psi - \gamma^0 \psi \gamma_0) &= m c \inv{2i} (\psi +\gamma^0 \psi \gamma_0)
\end{align*}

In comparison to the electric and magnetic fields does it make sense to introduce electric-like and magnetic-like field variables.  Say:

\begin{align*}
\psi_E &= \inv{2i} (\psi + \gamma^0 \psi \gamma_0) \\
\psi_B &= \inv{2} (\psi - \gamma^0 \psi \gamma_0)
\end{align*}

With these our field equations in spacetime split form are

\begin{align*}
\hbar \grad \psi_B &= m c \psi_E \\
\hbar \grad \psi_E &= m c \psi_B \\
\end{align*}

Adding the field equations $\psi_E$ and $\psi_B$ we have

\begin{align*}
\grad (\psi_E + \psi_B) &= \frac{m c}{\hbar} (\psi_E + \psi_B) \\ 
\end{align*}

In terms of a total field variable $\psi_T = \psi_E + \psi_B$ we have

\begin{align*}
\grad \psi_T &= \frac{m c}{\hbar} \psi_T
\end{align*}

It is interesting is the fact we were able to completely absorb the imaginary factor $i$ into the field, leaving only geometrical objects.
We are left with a combined field equation for a field variable with scalar, vector, bivector, and trivector parts.  This is very much like the Maxwell equation, which is
also a first order spacetime gradient, but one for which the entire
field equation has all of these grades.

\begin{align*}
\grad F &= \frac{J}{\epsilon_0 c}
\end{align*}

Is there anything to such similarities, and any physical significance?  Only additional study will show.  Understanding how the $A$ terms of the Lagrangian fits (ie: 
study of Gauge invariance) is likely the next logical step.
Also, can we write a Lagrangian for this total field that has no reliance on the original even field $\psi$
and its Dirac adjoint $\bar\psi$?

\section{ Alternate Dirac Lagrangian with antisymmetric terms. }

Now, 
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_equation#Adjoint_equation_and_Dirac_current}{Adjoint equation and Dirac current} lists the Lagrangian as

\begin{align*}
\LL = mc \bar{\psi}\psi - {\inv{2}i\hbar}(\bar{\psi}\gamma^\mu (\partial_\mu\psi) - (\partial_\mu\bar{\psi})\gamma^\mu \psi)
\end{align*}
