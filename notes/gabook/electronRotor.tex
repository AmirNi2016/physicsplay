\section{ Motivation. }

Both \cite{baylis-2007} and \cite{doran2003gap} cover rotor formulations
of the Lorentz force equation.  Work through some of this on my own to 
better understand it.

\section{ In terms of GA. }

An active Lorentz transformation can be used to translate from the rest frame of a particle with worldline $x$ to 
an observer frame, as in

\begin{align}
y &= \Lambda x \Lambda^\dagger
\end{align}

Here Lorentz transformation is used in the general sense, and can include both spatial rotation and boost effects, but satisfies $\Lambda\Lambda^\dagger = 1$.  Taking proper time derivatives we have

\begin{align*}
\ydot 
&= \Lambdadot x \Lambda^\dagger + \Lambda x \Lambdadot^\dagger \\
&= \Lambda \left(\Lambda^\dagger \Lambdadot\right) x \Lambda^\dagger + \Lambda x \left(\Lambdadot^\dagger \Lambda \right) \Lambda^\dagger \\
\end{align*}

Since $\Lambda^\dagger\Lambda = \Lambda\Lambda^\dagger = 1$ we also have

\begin{align*}
0 &= \Lambdadot\Lambda^\dagger + \Lambda\Lambdadot^\dagger  \\
0 &= \Lambda^\dagger\Lambdadot + \Lambdadot^\dagger\Lambda
\end{align*}

Here's where a bivector variable 

\begin{align}
\Omega/2 = \Lambda^\dagger \Lambdadot
\end{align}

is introduced, from which we have $\Lambdadot^\dagger \Lambda = -\Omega/2$, and

\begin{align*}
\ydot &= \inv{2} \left( \Lambda \Omega x \Lambda^\dagger - \Lambda x \Omega \Lambda^\dagger \right) \\
\end{align*}

Or
\begin{align*}
\Lambda^\dagger \ydot \Lambda &= \inv{2} \left( \Omega x - x \Omega \right) \\
\end{align*}

The inclusion of the factor of two in the definition of $\Omega$ was cheating, so that we get the bivector vector dot product above.  Presuming $\Omega$ is really a bivector (return to this in a bit), we then have

\begin{align}
\Lambda^\dagger \ydot \Lambda &= \Omega \cdot x 
\end{align}

We can express the time evolution of $y$ using this as a stepping stone, since we have

\begin{align*}
\Lambda^\dagger y \Lambda &= x 
\end{align*}

Using this we have
\begin{align*}
0 
&= \gpgradeone{ \Lambda^\dagger \ydot \Lambda - \Omega \cdot x } \\
&= \gpgradeone{ \Lambda^\dagger \ydot \Lambda - \Omega x } \\
&= \gpgradeone{ \Lambda^\dagger \ydot \Lambda - \Omega \Lambda^\dagger y \Lambda } \\
&= \gpgradeone{ \left( \Lambda^\dagger \ydot - \Lambda^\dagger \Lambda \Omega \Lambda^\dagger y \right) \Lambda } \\
&= \gpgradeone{ \Lambda^\dagger \left( \ydot - \Lambda \Omega \Lambda^\dagger y \right) \Lambda } \\
\end{align*}

So we have the complete time evolution of our observer frame worldline for the particle, as a sort of an eigenvalue 
equation for the proper time differential operator

\begin{align*}
\ydot 
&= \left( \Lambda \Omega \Lambda^\dagger \right) \cdot y = \left( 2 \Lambdadot \Lambda^\dagger \right) \cdot y 
\end{align*}

Now, what 
\href{http://www.ime.unicamp.br/%7Eicca8/videos/baylis.avi}{Baylis did in his lecture}, and what Doran/Lasenby did as
well in the text (but I didn't understand it then when I read it the first time) was to identify this time evolution
in terms of Lorentz transform change with the Lorentz force.

Recall that the Lorentz force equation is

\begin{align*}
\vdot = \frac{e}{m c} F \cdot v
\end{align*}

where $F = \BE + i c \BB$, like $\Lambdadot\Lambda^\dagger$ is also a bivector.  If we write the velocity worldline
of the particle in the lab frame in terms of the rest frame particle worldline as

\begin{align*}
v = \Lambda c t \gamma_0 \Lambda^\dagger
\end{align*}

Then for the field $F$ observed in the lab frame we are left with a differential equation 
$2 \Lambdadot \Lambda^\dagger = e F / mc$
for the Lorentz transformation
that produces the observed motion of the particle given the field that acts on it

\begin{align}
\Lambdadot = \frac{e}{2 m c} F \Lambda
\end{align}

Okay, good.  I understand now well enough what they've done to reproduce the end result (with the exception of my 
result including a factor of $c$ since they've worked with $c=1$).

\subsection{ Omega bivector. }

It's been assumed above that $\Omega = 2 \Lambda^\dagger \Lambdadot$ is a bivector.  Let's verify this.  Suppose to start
with that we consider only pure spatial rotations as a simple case.  Say

\begin{align*}
R_\theta(x) &= \Lambda x \Lambda^\dagger \\
\Lambda &= \exp( i n \theta/ 2 )
\end{align*}

where $n$ is a spatial unit bivector, $n^2 = 1$, in the span of $\{\sigma_k = \gamma_k \gamma_0\}$.
