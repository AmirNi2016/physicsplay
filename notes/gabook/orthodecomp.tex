\chapter{Orthogonal decomposition take II.} 
\label{chap:orthodecomp}

\section{Lemma.  Orthogonal decomposition.}
To do so we first need to be able to express a vector $\Bx$ in terms
of components parallel and perpendicular to the blade $\BA \in \wedge^k$.

\begin{align*}
\Bx 
&= \Bx \BA \inv{\BA} \\
&= (\Bx \cdot \BA + \Bx \wedge \BA) \inv{\BA} \\
&= 
(\Bx \cdot \BA) \cdot \inv{\BA}
+ \sum_{i=3,5,\cdots,2k-1} \gpgrade{(\Bx \cdot \BA) \inv{\BA}}{i} \\
&+ 
(\Bx \wedge \BA) \cdot \inv{\BA}
+ \sum_{i=3,5,\cdots,2k-1} \gpgrade{(\Bx \wedge \BA) \inv{\BA}}{i} 
+ \underbrace{(\Bx \wedge \BA) \wedge \inv{\BA}}_{=0}
\end{align*}

Since the LHS and RHS must both be vectors all the non-grade one terms
are either zero or cancel out.  This can be observed directly since:

\begin{align*}
\gpgrade{\Bx \cdot \BA \inv{\BA}}{i}
&= \gpgrade{ \frac{\Bx \BA - (-1)^{k}\BA\Bx}{2}\inv{\BA} }{i}  \\
&= -\frac{(-1)^{k}}{2} \gpgrade{ \BA\Bx \inv{\BA} }{i}  \\
\end{align*}

and

\begin{align*}
\gpgrade{\Bx \wedge \BA \inv{\BA}}{i} 
&= \gpgrade{ \frac{\Bx \BA + (-1)^{k}\BA\Bx}{2}\inv{\BA} }{i}  \\
&= +\frac{(-1)^{k}}{2} \gpgrade{ \BA\Bx \inv{\BA} }{i}  \\
\end{align*}

Thus all of the grade $3, \cdots ,2k-1$ terms cancel each other out.  Some terms
like $(\Bx \cdot \BA) \wedge \inv{\BA}$ are also independently zero.

(This is a result I've got in other places, but I thought it's worth
 writing down since I thought the direct cancellation is elegant).
