\section{ Motivation. }

The Bohr model is taught as early as high school chemistry when the various orbitals are
discussed (or maybe it was high school physics).  I recall
that the first time I saw this I didn't see where all the ideas came from.
With a bit more math under my belt now, reexamine these ideas as a lead up to
the proper wave mechanics.

\section{ Stuff. }

A prerequisite to discussing electron orbits is first setting up the equations of motion
for the two charged particles (ie: the proton and electron).

With the proton position at $\Br_p$, and the electron at $\Br_e$, we have two equations, one
for the force on the proton from the electron and the other for the force on the proton from
the electron.  These are respectively

\begin{align}\label{eqn:chargeEquations}
  \K e^2 \frac { \Br_e - \Br_p } { \Abs{\Br_e - \Br_p}^3 } &= m_p \frac{d^2 \Br_p }{dt^2} \\
- \K e^2 \frac { \Br_e - \Br_p } { \Abs{\Br_e - \Br_p}^3 } &= m_e \frac{d^2 \Br_e }{dt^2}
\end{align}

In liew of a picture, setting $\Br_p = 0$ works to check signs, leaving an inwards force on the electron as desired.

As usual for a two body problem, use of the difference vector and center of mass vector is desirable.  That is

\begin{align*}
\Bx &= \Br_e - \Br_p \\
M &= m_e + m_p \\
\BR &= \inv{M}(m_e \Br_e + m_p \Br_p)
\end{align*}

Solving for $\Br_p$ and $\Br_e$ in terms of $\BR$ and $\Bx$ we have

\begin{align*}
\Br_e &= \frac{m_p}{M} \Bx + \BR \\
\Br_p &= \frac{-m_e}{M} \Bx + \BR \\
\end{align*}

% check:
%r_e - r_p = M/M x
%m_e \Br_e + m_p \Br_p &= \frac{-m_e m_p}{M} \Bx + m_e \BR + \frac{m_p m_e}{M} \Bx + m_p \BR \\

Substitution back into \ref{eqn:chargeEquations} we have

\begin{align*}
  \K e^2 \frac {\Bx} { \Abs{\Bx}^3 } &= m_p \frac{d^2}{dt^2}\left( \frac{-m_e}{M} \Bx + \BR \right) \\
 -\K e^2 \frac {\Bx} { \Abs{\Bx}^3 } &= m_e \frac{d^2}{dt^2}\left( \frac{m_p}{M} \Bx + \BR \right),
\end{align*}

and sums and (scaled) differences of that give us our reduced mass equation and constant center-of-mass velocity equation
\begin{align}
\frac{d^2 \Bx}{dt^2} &= -\K e^2 \frac {\Bx} { \Abs{\Bx}^3 } \left( \inv{m_e} + \inv{m_p} \right) \\
\frac{d^2 \BR}{dt^2} &= 0
\end{align}

writing $1/\mu = 1/m_e + 1/m_p$, and $k = e^2/4 \pi \epsilon_0$, our difference vector equation is thus

\begin{align}\label{eqn:reduceEOM}
\mu \frac{d^2 \Bx}{dt^2} &= -k \frac {\Bx} { \Abs{\Bx}^3 }
\end{align}

Now, the next step in the Bohr argument was that the angular momentum, a conserved quantity is also quantized.  To give real
meaning to the conservation statement we need the equivalent Lagrangian formulation of \ref{eqn:reduceEOM}.  Anti differentiation
gives

\begin{align*}
\grad_\Bv \left( \inv{2} \mu \Bv^2 \right) &= k \xcap \partial_x \inv{x} = - \grad_\Bx \underbrace{\left(- k\inv{\Abs{\Bx}}\right)}_{=\phi}
\end{align*}

So, our Lagrangian is
\begin{align*}
\LL = K - \phi = \inv{2} \mu \Bv^2 + k \inv{\Abs{\Bx}}
\end{align*}
