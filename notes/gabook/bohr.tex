\section{ Motivation. }

The Bohr model is taught as early as high school chemistry when the various orbitals are
discussed (or maybe it was high school physics).  I recall
that the first time I saw this I didn't see where all the ideas came from.
With a bit more math under my belt now, reexamine these ideas as a lead up to
the proper wave mechanics.

\section{ Stuff. }

A prerequisite to discussing electron orbits is first setting up the equations of motion
for the two charged particles (ie: the proton and electron).

With the proton position at $\Br_p$, and the electron at $\Br_e$, we have two equations, one
for the force on the proton from the electron and the other for the force on the proton from
the electron.  These are respectively

\begin{align}\label{eqn:chargeEquations}
  \K e^2 \frac { \Br_e - \Br_p } { \Abs{\Br_e - \Br_p}^3 } &= m_p \frac{d^2 \Br_p }{dt^2} \\
- \K e^2 \frac { \Br_e - \Br_p } { \Abs{\Br_e - \Br_p}^3 } &= m_e \frac{d^2 \Br_e }{dt^2}
\end{align}

In liew of a picture, setting $\Br_p = 0$ works to check signs, leaving an inwards force on the electron as desired.

% FIXME: Add one.

As usual for a two body problem, use of the difference vector and center of mass vector is desirable.  That is

\begin{align*}
\Bx &= \Br_e - \Br_p \\
M &= m_e + m_p \\
\BR &= \inv{M}(m_e \Br_e + m_p \Br_p)
\end{align*}

Solving for $\Br_p$ and $\Br_e$ in terms of $\BR$ and $\Bx$ we have

\begin{align*}
\Br_e &= \frac{m_p}{M} \Bx + \BR \\
\Br_p &= \frac{-m_e}{M} \Bx + \BR \\
\end{align*}

% check:
%r_e - r_p = M/M x
%m_e \Br_e + m_p \Br_p &= \frac{-m_e m_p}{M} \Bx + m_e \BR + \frac{m_p m_e}{M} \Bx + m_p \BR \\

Substitution back into \ref{eqn:chargeEquations} we have

\begin{align*}
  \K e^2 \frac {\Bx} { \Abs{\Bx}^3 } &= m_p \frac{d^2}{dt^2}\left( \frac{-m_e}{M} \Bx + \BR \right) \\
 -\K e^2 \frac {\Bx} { \Abs{\Bx}^3 } &= m_e \frac{d^2}{dt^2}\left( \frac{m_p}{M} \Bx + \BR \right),
\end{align*}

and sums and (scaled) differences of that give us our reduced mass equation and constant center-of-mass velocity equation
\begin{align}
\frac{d^2 \Bx}{dt^2} &= -\K e^2 \frac {\Bx} { \Abs{\Bx}^3 } \left( \inv{m_e} + \inv{m_p} \right) \\
\frac{d^2 \BR}{dt^2} &= 0
\end{align}

writing $1/\mu = 1/m_e + 1/m_p$, and $k = e^2/4 \pi \epsilon_0$, our difference vector equation is thus

\begin{align}\label{eqn:reduceEOM}
\mu \frac{d^2 \Bx}{dt^2} &= -k \frac {\Bx} { \Abs{\Bx}^3 }
\end{align}

The Bohr model postulates that electron orbits are circular.  It's easy enough to verify that a circular orbit in the center of mass frame is a solution to equation
\ref{eqn:reduceEOM}.   Write the path in terms of the unit bivector for the plane of rotation $i$ and an initial vector position $\Bx_0$

\begin{align*}
\Bx = \Bx_0 e^{i \omega t}
\end{align*}

For constant $i$ and $\omega$, we have

\begin{align*}
\mu \Bx_0 (i\omega)^2 e^{i\omega t} = - k \frac{\Bx_0}{\Abs{\Bx_0}^3} e^{i\omega t}
\end{align*}

This provides the 
angular velocity in terms of the reduced mass of the system and the charge constants

\begin{align*}
\omega^2 = k \inv{\Abs{\Bx_0}^3} = \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \inv{\Abs{\Bx_0}^3}.
\end{align*}

Although not relavant to the quantum theme, it's hard not to call out the observation that this is
a Kepler's law like relation for the period of the circular orbit given the radial distance from the center of mass

\begin{align*}
%T^2 = ( 2 \pi ) \frac{4 \pi \epsilon_0}{e^2} \Abs{\Bx_0}^3.
T^2 = \frac{8 \pi^2 \epsilon_0}{e^2} \Abs{\Bx_0}^3
\end{align*}

(although Kepler's law also holds for eliptical orbits which takes more work to show).

% for non-constant \omega: \alpha = \omega t
%(e^i\alpha)'' 
%= (i\alpha' e^i\alpha)'
%= (i\alpha'' - (\alpha')^2)e^i\alpha

Now, the next step in the Bohr argument was that the angular momentum, a conserved quantity is also quantized.  To give real
meaning to the conservation statement we need the equivalent Lagrangian formulation of \ref{eqn:reduceEOM}.  Anti differentiation
gives

\begin{align*}
\grad_\Bv \left( \inv{2} \mu \Bv^2 \right) 
&= k \xcap \partial_x \inv{x} \\
&= - \grad_\Bx \underbrace{\left(- k\inv{\Abs{\Bx}}\right)}_{=\phi}
\end{align*}

So, our Lagrangian is
\begin{align*}
\LL = K - \phi = \inv{2} \mu \Bv^2 + k \inv{\Abs{\Bx}}
\end{align*}

The essence of the conservation argument, an application of 
Noether's theorem,
is that a rotational transformation of the Lagrangian leaves this energy relationship unchanged.  Essentially repeating 
the angular momentum example from \cite{PJEulerLagrange} (which was done for a general radial Langrangian potential), we 
write $i$ for the unit bivector associated with a rotational plane.  The position vector is transformed by rotation in this plane as follows

\begin{align*}
\Bx &\rightarrow \Bx' \\
\Bx' &= R \Bx R^\dagger \\
R &= \exp{i\theta/2}
\end{align*}

The magnitude of the position vector is rotation invariant

\begin{align*}
(\Bx')^2 &= R \Bx R^\dagger R \Bx R^\dagger = \Bx^2,
\end{align*}

as is our the square of the transformed velocity.  The transformed velocity is

\begin{align*}
\frac{d\Bx'}{dt} &= \dot{R} \Bx R + R \dot{\Bx} R^\dagger + R \Bx \dot{R}^\dagger
\end{align*}

but with $\dot{\theta} = 0$, $\dot{R} = 0$ its square is just

\begin{align*}
(\Bv')^2 &= R {\Bv} R^\dagger R \dot{\Bv} R^\dagger = \Bv^2.
\end{align*}

We therefore have a Lagrangian that is invarient under this rotational transformation

\begin{align*}
\LL \rightarrow \LL' = \LL,
\end{align*}

and by Noether's theorem (essentially application of the chain rule), we have

\begin{align*}
\frac{d\LL'}{d\theta}
&= \frac{d}{dt} \left(\frac{d\Bx'}{d\theta} \cdot \grad_{\Bv'} \LL \right) \\
&= \frac{d}{dt} \left( (i \cdot \Bx') \cdot \mu \Bv' \right).
\end{align*}

But $d\LL'/d\theta = 0$, so we have for any $i$

\begin{align*}
(i \cdot \Bx') \cdot (\mu \Bv') &= i \cdot (\Bx' \wedge (\mu \Bv')) = \text{constant}
\end{align*}

% - then quantization.
% - discuss connection to Sch. results?
% - use numbers to see how relativistic the velocities are.  compare hydrogen and massive nuclii.
% - try: proper maxwell's/Lorentz equations instead of just the Coulomb force.
