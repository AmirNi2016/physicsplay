\section{ Motivation }

Derive the conservation laws for the time rate of change of the Poynting vector, which appears to be a momentum density like quantity.

The Poynting conservation relationship has been derived previously.  Additionally a starting
exploration 
\cite{PJemstresstensor}
of the related four vector quantity has been related to a subset of the energy momentum stress tensor.
This was incomplete since the meaning of the $T_{kj}$ terms of the tensor were unknown and the expected
Lorentz transform relationships had not been determined.  The aim here is to try to figure out this remainder.

\section{ Calculation }

Repeating again from \cite{PJpoynting}, the electrodynamic energy density $U$ and momentum flux density vectors are related as follows

\begin{align}\label{eqn:fromPoyntingNotes}
U &= \frac{\epsilon_0}{2}\left( \BE^2 + c^2 \BB^2 \right) \\
\BP &= \inv{\mu_0}\BE \cross \BB = \inv{\mu_0} (i \BB) \cdot \BE \\
0 &= \PD{t}{U} + \spacegrad \cdot \BP + \BE \cdot \Bj
\end{align}

We want to now calculate the time rate of change of this Poynting (field momentum density) vector.

\begin{align*}
\PD{t}{\BP}
&= \PD{t}{} \left( \inv{\mu_0} \BE \cross \BB \right) \\
&= \PD{t}{} \left( \inv{\mu_0}(i\BB) \cdot \BE \right) \\
&= \partial_0 \left( \inv{\mu_0}(i c\BB) \cdot \BE \right) \\
&= \inv{\mu_0} \left( \partial_0 (i c\BB) \cdot \BE  + (i c\BB) \cdot \partial_0 \BE  \right)
\end{align*}

%Let's ignore the $\mu_0$ factor for now, and focus just on the field dot products.  
We will want to express these time derivatives in
terms of the current and spatial derivatives to determine the conservation identity.  To do this let's go back to Maxwell's equation
once more, with a premultiplication by $\gamma_0$ to provide us with an observer dependent spacetime split

\begin{align*}
\gamma_0 \grad F &= \gamma_0 J / \epsilon_0 c \\
(\partial_0 + \spacegrad) ( \BE + i c \BB ) &= \rho/\epsilon_0 - \Bj/\epsilon_0 c \\
\end{align*}

We want the grade one and grade two components for the time derivative terms.  For grade one we have

\begin{align*}
- \Bj/\epsilon_0 c
&= \gpgradeone{(\partial_0 + \spacegrad) ( \BE + i c \BB )} \\
&= \partial_0 \BE + \spacegrad \cdot (ic \BB)
\end{align*}

and for grade two
\begin{align*}
0 
&= \gpgradetwo{(\partial_0 + \spacegrad) ( \BE + i c \BB )} \\
&= \partial_0 (i c \BB) + \spacegrad \wedge \BE
\end{align*}

Using these we can express the time derivatives for back substitution
\begin{align*}
\partial_0 \BE &= - \Bj/\epsilon_0 c - \spacegrad \cdot (ic \BB) \\
\partial_0 (i c \BB) &= -\spacegrad \wedge \BE
\end{align*}

yielding
\begin{align*}
\mu_0 \PD{t}{\BP}
&= \partial_0 (i c\BB) \cdot \BE  + (i c\BB) \cdot \partial_0 \BE \\
&= -(\spacegrad \wedge \BE) \cdot \BE  - (i c\BB) \cdot \left( \Bj/\epsilon_0 c + \spacegrad \cdot (ic \BB) \right) \\
\end{align*}

Or
\begin{align*}
\PD{t}{(i\BB) \cdot \BE} +(\spacegrad \wedge \BE) \cdot \BE + (i c\BB) \cdot (\spacegrad \cdot (ic \BB)) &= - (i c\BB) \cdot \Bj/\epsilon_0 c \\
\end{align*}

Now, while this contains the essence of the momentum conservation it is a bit sloppy.  We expect something like the four vector
divergence as we had in the Poynting energy/momentum density equations.  Let's see if we can put the second two terms into
the form of a spatial divergence.  The expectation here since we have vector quantities all around is that this will be the spatial 
divergence of a bivector quantity of some sort.  Also note that the Poynting vector is also really the dual of a bivector,
and that we have an implicit cross product in dual form with the current density vector on the right hand side as well.
