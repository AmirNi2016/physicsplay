\section{ Motivation. }

Fill in the gaps for a reading of the
Rayleigh-Jeans discussion of \cite{bohm1989qt}.

\section{ 2. Electromagnetic energy. }

Energy of the field given to be:

\begin{align*}
E = \inv{8\pi} \int (\EE + \HH)
\end{align*}

I still don't really know where this comes from.
Could perhaps justify this with a Hamiltonian of a field (although this is
uncomfortably abstract).

With the particle Hamiltonian we have

\begin{align*}
H = \qdot_i p_i -\LL
\end{align*}

What is the field equivalent of this?  Try to get the feel for this with some simple fields (such as the one dimensional vibrating string), and the Coulomb field.  For the physical case, do this with both the Hamitonian approach and a physical limiting argument.
