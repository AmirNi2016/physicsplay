\section{ Motivation. }

In \cite{PJfourierMaxwellSecondOrder} solutions of Maxwell's equation
via Fourier transformation of the four potential forced wave equations were
explored.

Here a first order solution is attempted, by directly Fourier transforming
the Maxwell's equation in bivector form.

\section{ Setup. }
