\section{ Putting Maxwell's equation in curl form. }

These notes are followup for

\href{http://www.geocities.com/peeter_joot/geometric_algebra/vector_integral_relations.pdf}{vector\_integral\_relations.pdf}
, applying the bivector stokes volume equation

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:summaryStokesVolume}
\iiint (\grad \wedge F) \cdot d^3\Bx = \oiintclockwise F \cdot d^2\Bx,
\end{equation}

to the electromagnetic field bivector equation

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:maxwell}
\grad F = J/\epsilon_0 c.
\end{equation}

taking vector and trivector parts we have two equations
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:maxwellv}
\grad \cdot F = J/\epsilon_0 c,
\end{equation}

and
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:maxwellt}
\grad \wedge F = 0.
\end{equation}

\subsection{ Trivector equation part. }

The second of these, equation \ref{eqn:maxwellt}, we can apply Stokes to
directly:

\begin{equation}
\iiint (\grad \wedge F) \cdot d^3 \Bx = \oiintclockwise F \cdot d^2\Bx = 0.
\end{equation}

This area integral is a flux like quantity.  Suppose we call this the field flux, then this says
says
the flux of the combined electromagnetic field through any surface is zero
independent of the charge or current densities.
Note that here $d^3\Bx$
can be a regular spatial volume trivector element, but one can also pick
a spacetime (area times time) ``volume'' to integrate over, in which case
$d^2\Bx$ are the oriented ``surfaces'' of such a spacetime volume.

This doesn't seem like a result that I'm familiar with based on the traditional
vector forms of Maxwell’s equation.  Perhaps it is recognizable in terms of
$\BE$ and $\BB$ explicitly:

\begin{equation}
\oiintclockwise \BE \cdot d^2\Bx = - c \oiintclockwise \BB \cdot (d^2\Bx I)
\end{equation}

Note also the subtle difference from traditional vector treatments where
$\BE$ and $\BB$ were spatial vectors.  Here they are writen as spacetime
bivectors,
$\BE = E^i \sigma_i = E^i \gamma_i \wedge \gamma_0$,
$\BB = B^i \sigma_i = B^i \gamma_i \wedge \gamma_0$.

Although this still doesn't look like a familiar identity, some observations
can be made.

Only the spacetime surfaces of the volume
contribute to the LHS integral since $\sigma_i \cdot (\gamma_j \wedge \gamma_k) = 0$.

For the RHS, only the purely spatial surfaces contribute to that $\BB$ integral, since the dual surface $d^2\Bx I$ must have a spacetime component for that dot product to be non-zero.

I will have to come back to this and
see if this is useful for any types of calculations.

\subsection{ Vector part. }

Moving on to the charge and current dependent vector terms
of Maxwell’s equation, we want express equation \ref{eqn:maxwellv} as a
spacetime curl so that we can apply stokes to it.

We can do this by temporarily writing our field in terms of a potential, and a
bivector dual to that.

\begin{align*}
F = \grad \wedge A = I D
\end{align*}
\begin{align*}
\grad F
&= \grad (\grad \wedge A) \\
&= \grad \cdot (\grad \wedge A) + \grad \wedge (\grad \wedge A) \\
&= \grad \cdot (I D) \\
&= \gpgradeone{ \grad I D } \\
&= -\gpgradeone{ I (\underbrace{\grad \cdot D}_{1-\text{vector}} + \underbrace{\grad \wedge D}_{3-\text{vector}}) } \\
&= - I (\grad \wedge D) \\
\end{align*}

or
\begin{align*}
I \grad F = \grad \wedge D.
\end{align*}

Applying stokes we have
\begin{align*}
\int (\grad \wedge D) \cdot d^3\Bx &= \oiintclockwise D \cdot d^2\Bx \\
\int (I \grad F) \cdot d^3\Bx
&= \oiintclockwise (-I F) \cdot d^2\Bx \\
&= \oiintclockwise \gpgradezero{ - F d^2\Bx I } \\
&= -\oiintclockwise F \cdot (d^2\Bx I) \\
\inv{\epsilon_0 c} \int (I J) \cdot d^3\Bx &= \\
\inv{\epsilon_0 c} \int \gpgradezero{ I J d^3\Bx } &= \\
\inv{\epsilon_0 c} \int \gpgradezero{ J d^3\Bx I } &= \\
\inv{\epsilon_0 c} \int J \cdot (d^3\Bx I) &= \\
\end{align*}

Or
\begin{equation}
\oiintctrclockwise F \cdot (d^2\Bx I) = \int \frac{J}{\epsilon_0 c} \cdot (d^3\Bx I)
\end{equation}

This is the integral form of Maxwells equation \ref{eqn:maxwell}.
This doens't look terribly familiar, but we aren't used to
seeing Maxwell's equations in a non-disassembled form.
Hiding in there should be all
of the traditional eight Maxwells equations in integral form dependent on the
volume and corresponding surface integrated over.

\section{ Extracting the vector integral forms of Maxwell's equations. }

One can extract the integral forms of Maxwell's equations by applying the
spatial forms of the divergence and stokes equations on the vector forms
of Maxwell's equations once those are extracted from \ref{eqn:maxwell}.
However, having formulated Stokes equation in its bivector form
we can go directly to those equations by appropriate selection of spatial
or spacetime volumes.
Of course we also now have new tools to work with the field in its entirety,
but lets use this as an exercise to verify that all the previous computation
that led to Stokes equation gives us the expected results.  In particular
this should be a good way to verify that
sign mistakes or other similar small errors (which would not be too hard)
have not been made.
