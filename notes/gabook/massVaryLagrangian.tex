\section{}

Hi Mentz, yes I get the same result:

\begin{equation*}
\ddot{x} = -\frac{m_x \dot{x}^2}{2 m}
\end{equation*}

However, I don't understand anything GR related that you did after that;)

Fwiw, I was able to do the same derivatives with proper time/velocity and I get:

\begin{equation*}
m\dot{v} + v \sum \dot{x}^{\beta} \frac{\partial m}{\partial x^{\beta}} = \frac{1}{2} v^2 \nabla m
\end{equation*}

where:
\begin{equation*}
v = \sum \gamma_{\mu} \dot{x}^{\mu}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
\nabla = \sum \gamma^{\mu} \frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\mu}}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
\gamma^{\mu} \cdot \gamma_{\nu} = {\delta^{\mu}}_{\nu}
\end{equation*}

I don't know if this is what you were also getting (and for GR I have the suspision that you let the frame vectors vary with position/time)?
