\section{ Motivation. }

Stanford iTunesU has some Fourier transform lectures by Prof. Brad Osgood.
He starts with Fourier series and by Lecture 5 has covered this and
the solution of the Heat equation on a ring as an example.

Now, for these lectures I get only sound on my ipod.  I can listen along and
pick up most of the lectures since this is review material, but here's some
notes to firm things up.

Since this heat equation

\begin{align*}
\grad^2 u = \kappa \partial_t u
\end{align*}

is also the Schr\"{o}dinger equation once the 
constant is fixed appropriately, we can also apply this to a particle
constrained to a circle, and contrast this with Susskind's solution of the
same problem (where he used the Fourier transform).

\section{ Preliminaries. }

\subsection{ Laplacian. }

Osgood wrote the heat equation for the ring as

\begin{align*}
\inv{2} u_xx = u_t
\end{align*}

where $x$ represented an angular position on the ring, and where
he set the heat diffusion constant to $1/2$ for convienience.
To apply this to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation retaining all the desired
units we want to be a bit more careful, so let's start with the Laplacian
in cylindrical polar coordinates.
