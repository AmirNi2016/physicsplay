\section{ Motivation. }

Stanford iTunesU has some Fourier transform lectures by Prof. Brad Osgood.
He starts with Fourier series and by Lecture 5 has covered this and
the solution of the Heat equation on a ring as an example.

Now, for these lectures I get only sound on my ipod.  I can listen along and
pick up most of the lectures since this is review material, but here's some
notes to firm things up.

Since this heat equation

\begin{align}
\grad^2 u = \kappa \partial_t u
\end{align}

is also the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for a free particle in one 
dimension (once the 
constant is fixed appropriately), we can also apply the Fourier
technique to a particle
constrained to a circle.  It would be interesting afterwards to 
contrast this with Susskind's solution of the
same problem (where he used the Fourier transform and algebraic techniques
instead).

\section{ Preliminaries. }

\subsection{ Laplacian. }

Osgood wrote the heat equation for the ring as

\begin{align*}
\inv{2} u_{xx} = u_t
\end{align*}

where $x$ represented an angular position on the ring, and where
he set the heat diffusion constant to $1/2$ for convienience.
To apply this to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation retaining all the desired
units we want to be a bit more careful, so let's start with the Laplacian
in polar coordinates.

In polar coordinates our gradient is

\begin{align*}
\grad = \thetacap \inv{r} \PD{\theta}{} +\rcap \PD{r}{} 
\end{align*}

squaring this we have

\begin{align*}
\grad^2 = \grad \cdot \grad
&= 
\thetacap \inv{r} \PD{\theta}{} \cdot \left(\thetacap \inv{r} \PD{\theta}{}\right)
 +
\rcap \PD{r}{} \cdot \left(\rcap \PD{r}{} \right) \\
&= 
\frac{-1}{r^3} \PD{\theta}{r} \PD{\theta}{}
+\inv{r^2} \PDSq{\theta}{}
+ \PDSq{r}{}
\\
&= \inv{r^2} \PDSq{\theta}{} + \PDSq{r}{} \\
\end{align*}

So for the circularly constrained where $r$ is constant case we have simply

\begin{align}
\grad^2 = \inv{r^2} \PDSq{\theta}{}
\end{align}

and our heat equation to solve becomes

\begin{align}
\PDSq{\theta}{u(\theta, t)} = (r^2 \kappa) \PD{t}{u(\theta, t)}
\end{align}

\subsection{ Fourier series. }

Now we also want Fourier series for a given period.  Assuming the absence of the "Rigor Police" as Osgood puts it
we write for a periodic function $f(x)$ known on the interval $I = [a, a+T]$

\begin{align*}
f(x) = \sum c_k e^{2\pi i k x/T}
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
\int_{\partial I} f(x) e^{- 2 \pi i m x /T} 
&= \sum c_k \int_{\partial I} e^{2\pi i (k -m) x/T} \\
&= c_m T
\end{align*}

So our Fourier coefficient is
\begin{align*}
\hat{f}(k) = c_k = \inv{T} \int_{\partial I} f(x) e^{- 2 \pi i m x /T} 
\end{align*}

\section{ Solution of heat equation. } 

\subsection{ Basic solution. }

Now we are ready to solve the radial heat equation

\begin{align}\label{eqn:heatRadial}
u_{\theta\theta} = r^2 \kappa u_t,
\end{align}

by assuming a Fourier series solution.

Suppose

\begin{align*}
u(\theta, t) 
&= \sum c_m(t) e^{2 \pi i m \theta / T} \\
&= \sum c_m(t) e^{i m \theta} \\
\end{align*}

Taking derivatives of this assumed solution we have
\begin{align*}
u_{\theta\theta} &= \sum (im)^2 c_m e^{i m \theta} \\
u_{t} &= \sum c_m' e^{i m \theta}
\end{align*}

Substituting this back into \ref{eqn:heatRadial} we have

\begin{align*}
\sum - m^2 c_m e^{ i m \theta} = \sum c_m' r^2 \kappa e^{i m \theta}
\end{align*}

equating components we have 

\begin{align*}
c_m' = - \frac{m^2}{ r^2 \kappa } c_m 
\end{align*}

which is also just an exponential.

\begin{align*}
c_m = A_m e^{- \frac{m^2}{ r^2 \kappa } t }
\end{align*}

Reassembling we have the time variation of the solution now fixed and can write

\begin{align}
u(\theta, t) = \sum A_m e^{- \frac{m^2}{ r^2 \kappa } t } e^{i m \theta}
\end{align}

\subsection{ As initial value problem. }

For the heat equation case, we can assume a known initial heat distribution 
$f(\theta)$.
For an initial time $t=0$ we can then write

\begin{align*}
u(\theta, 0) = \sum A_m e^{i m \theta} = f(\theta)
\end{align*}

This is just another Fourier series, with Fourier coefficients

\begin{align*}
A_m = \inv{2\pi} \int_{\partial I} f(v) e^{-i m v} dv
\end{align*}

Final reassembly of the results gives us

\begin{align}
u(\theta, t) = \sum e^{- \frac{m^2}{ r^2 \kappa } t } e^{i m \theta} \inv{2\pi} \int_{\partial I} f(v) e^{-i m v} dv
\end{align}

\subsection{ Convolution. }

Osgood's next step, also with the rigor police in hiding, was to exchange orders of integration and summation, to write

\begin{align*}
u(\theta, t) 
&= 
\int_{\partial I} f(v) dv \inv{2 \pi} \sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty} e^{- \frac{m^2}{ r^2 \kappa } t } e^{-i m (v -\theta)} \\
\end{align*}

Introducing a Green's function $g(v - \theta, t)$, we then have the complete solution in terms of convolution

\begin{align}
g( v - \theta, t ) &= \inv{2 \pi} \sum_{m=-\infty}^\infty e^{- \frac{m^2}{ r^2 \kappa } t } e^{-i m (v -\theta)} \\
u(\theta, t) &= \int_{\partial I} f(v) g(v - \theta, t) dv 
\end{align}

Now, this Green's function is fairly interesting.  By summing over paired negative and positive indexes, we have a set of
weighted Gaussians.

\begin{align*}
g( v - \theta, t ) &= \inv{2 \pi} + \sum_{m=1}^\infty \exp\left(- \frac{m^2}{ r^2 \kappa } t \right) \frac{\cos(m (v -\theta))}{\pi} \\
\end{align*}

Recalling that the delta function can be expressed as a limit of a $\sinc$ function, seeing something similar
in this Green's function is not entirely unsuprising seeming.

\section{ Wave equation. }

The QM equation for a free particle is

\begin{align*}
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \grad^2 \psi = i \hbar \partial_t \psi
\end{align*}

This has the same form of the heat equation, so for the free particle on a circle our wave equation is

\begin{align*}
\psi_{\theta\theta} = - \frac{2 m i r^2 }{\hbar} \partial_t \psi \quad \mbox{ ie: $\kappa = - 2 m i r^2 /\hbar$ }
\end{align*}

So, if the wave equation was known at an initial time $\psi(\theta, 0) = \phi(\theta)$, we therefore have by comparision the time 
evolution of the particle's wave function is

\begin{align*}
g( w, t ) &= \inv{2 \pi} + \sum_{k=1}^\infty \exp\left(- \frac{i \hbar k^2 t}{ 2 m r^4 } \right) \frac{\cos(k w )}{\pi} \\
\psi(\theta, t) &= \int_{\partial I} \phi(v) g(v - \theta, t) dv 
\end{align*}

TODO: contrast this to a Fourier transform solution.
