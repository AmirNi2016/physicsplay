- make a macro for formatting eq. for references to external formula numbers.

- \makeproblem doesn't wrap lines for the description when it is too long (which often appears to be the case).

- have some coupled macro dependencies.  Should break these out, as done with macros_bm

Figures submodule:  figure out which figures are orphaned.

misc:

gabook: 

   manual use of : \langle \rangle -> \gpgradezero
   manual use of \left( ... \right) -> \lr{}

classicalmechanics:

	\text{Re} -> \Real

reviewed up to ~page 170 of classicalmechanics for () -> \lr{} stuff using:

   ,$ s/(\(.*\))/\\lr{ \1 }/cg

Notice that I've got some \left( ... \mathLabelBox{} ... \right) .  Change to \Bigl( ... \Bigr)

- Switch from imageFigure to mathImageFigure for mathematica generate notebooks to include a link to the notebook that generated it.

Style checker:

- Look for unhandled {CAPTION} from figures.
- Be consistent about \text use in math mode.  \mathrm{} is often nicer.  Rule of thumb?  Use for x_{\text{}} locations, not for multiword text (such as if constraints in multiple option formulas)
- Look for common errors like cref{eqn: (instead of eqnref{eqn:) ... and for document local conventions like \Bx vs \vec{x} and _\nought vs. _0, _o, _\circ, ...

  \kB, \CV, ...

- files copied with ORIG_FILES and ORIG_FRONTBACK_FILES don't have the right dependencies.  to update any of these have to make clean ; make (same issue with ../phy454/ (and many of the other makefiles that have ORIG_FILES rules)).

   - Acknowledgment:
      - send postcard to classicthesis sty creator as requested.  Include urls.

   - saw reference to a script that ships with Latex that does what my make_pdflatex does (running latex/bib/makeindex repeatedly until done).
     Look up what that was and see about switching to it.

   - a number of older notes compilations could be switched to \makeproblem/makeanswer format for solved problems.  Especially:

      classicalmechanics
      phy356
      phy450
      phy454
      phy456

   - any places left to switch to \makeoproblem{} to mark origin of problem?  (parts of) classicalmechanics and phy454 is done.  phy485 too?

   - now have a bunch of spots like Maxwell's equation \eqnref, where there's a named equation followed by a \cref that will also generate a eq.  -- search those out and change to a different command (probably something that uses a plain reference).

   - cref's for figures look different than those for equations.  Could pretty that up and make them consistent.

   - With an eye on consistency, should probably hunt down all plain \ref's and use commands that can be given consistent formatting.

   - http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/19104/cleveref-with-counters-with-same-name comments suggest that \input should not specify the suffix.  Why?

   - myBoxed{} often makes the space too big at the top.
