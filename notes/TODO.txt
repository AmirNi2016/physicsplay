================================================================================================

PHY487
------

- use makeoproblem in problem set questions that came from the text book (and others for that sake showing what 
  problem set they came from).
- Fourier series TODO from lecture 7 phonons.

================================================================================================

PHY452
------

- probably remove: midterm1review.tex (now in the appendix)

- dups?
         \input{centralLimitOnProducts.tex}
         \input{productOfIIDCLT.tex}

- thermo chapter needs some reorg.

- toss in typo note for text into the appendix once confirmed.

- phase space chapter needs some reorg.

- probably eliminate the 'outline oof midterm I' solutions item.

- fixme's in lecture 17 (and perhaps elsewhere)

- check signs for all the n^b n_f results in lectures 15,16.

- introduced \EF and \kF macros, like \kB.  Still places that use the full expansions prior to those macros.

- perhaps move some of the recent macros out of peeters_macros.sty into thisbook.sty

- ps2: incorporate grading comments:
   b) calculate unbounded propagator?

- do more of the kittel problems (all the recommended ones from chapters 1-6,8)

- work through lecture 13 (spin interaction) myself filling in all the details.

- search for mathematica references and change to nbref (if any).

- L13: plot the specific heat, the partition function, the average energy, and the magnetization.

- have rules for eps -> pdf from huang 9.3 problem.  Those generated files should be in the clean rules and .gitignore rules. (have implemented wildcard rules for them)

- move the phy452/ eps wildcard rule for figures/ into ../make.rules/vars ?

- non-integer binomial series.  Verify result for non-integer negative exponents.

- post final exam problem rework.

================================================================================================

gabook
------

   - I had a TODO list for this notes collection.  Where did it go?
      found it: gabook/Changelog

================================================================================================

miscphysics
-----------

   - review this collection.  Probably lots that should be done.

================================================================================================

classicalmechanics
------------------

   - solve and write up the other phy354 problem sets and the midterm and final.  problem set 2 i/p.  want to look at the E - q \phi and do a comparison between the relativistic and non-rel results to see how they compare for small v.

   - have at least one complete lecture on paper and some partially written up lecture notes to finish up and add here.

   - rework some mult part goldstein and tong problems in makesubquestion/subanswer format.

================================================================================================

phy356
------

   - switch to \makeproblem/makeanswer format for solved problems.

================================================================================================

phy450
------
   - Give this a re-read and see what state it is in.

   - don't think I ever did any figures for this class.  Probably too much work to retrofit them.

================================================================================================

phy454
------

   - reorganization: inserted Das's name for textbook rework starting point.  Accidentally merged that into master, and undid it in:

      https://github.com/peeterjoot/physicsplay/commit/d1fd25d694335da181f1d5054094bdfacafdf1d5

      now switching to 454text branch doesn't work (? :... Can do on lagrangian).
      On checkout of 454text see the Das name changes there, but github shows the branch merged.  If that project goes anywhere may have to redo from the diff above (or the email to Das).  

   - Computational work:
      - attempt the problem to derive the compatibility condition.  Doing this should help resolve the issue of how the stress tensor can be applied.
      - coffee problem

   ==============

   ===============

   - Indexing:
      ( http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Indexing )

      -- got the make rules done (standalone sample: ../latex/index.tex).
      -- now have to add all the index tags.  Grabbed all my wordpress keywords and saved them to: indexTags.txt.  Do a search for those expressions
         and add \index{} entries, perhaps automatically to start with (i.e. first reference).

      - have commented out the \printindex in phy454.tex and stubbed the \index command in mycommon.sty... to much work to go retrofit index
        tags everywhere!

   - Exercises:
      - not entirely pleased with how the exercise environment ends up looking.  Could end up rewriting that using the latex templates sample.
      - put links back to questions in the answers.
      - Can add paragraph headings to give titles to sub-Question answers.
         - had done that (\unnumberedSubsection command), but was seeing weird effects with section titles emitted later after the environment closed ... like before the text in the summary sections).  backed all that out for now and replaced with plain old text.
      - \ref{} markers for multi-part questions aren't showing up well.  Looks like mis-interaction with \paragraph{}.  Probably do something more systematic, labeling these references with
         Question #: Text

   - Visual:
      - graphical cover page (stirred cup of coffee;) would be nice.

   - Figures:
      - go through all figures and re-draw many.
      - can open with Sketchbook express, and then turn the initial drawing into a hidden layer, tracing the original.

   - Examples:
      - add examples and problems to TOC and bookmarks.  Tried this in the \makeexample and \makeproblem commands, but it doesn't work right on second pass compilation.
      - would be nice to introduce a background color box for examples (light color).  Have a rule instead for now.
         Example of how to do this: ../latex/tcolorbox.tex
            ( from http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/44833/math-inside-tables-and-formatting/44840#44840 )

   - Computational work:
      - attempt the extra optional homework from handouts/ClassNote17.pdf

   - Latex:
      - would be nice to have the bib and index show up as parts directly without having to have chapter headings in the parts (like the preface and contents).
         One solution would be to flatten the chapters and then remove the parts.  Especially now that I've got most of my worked problems moved into Q/A environments (to be moved along with the relevant material).

      (phy485 looks better in this respect)

      - Make \FIXME conditional on classicthesis drafting variable.
         (or switch to \fixme package as done in phy485 notes).

   - Das would like his name in the notes so that he can show it to the publisher.

================================================================================================

phy456
------

   - would be nice to restructure to have a more systematic layout.  Put the various worked problems and notes from the readings as problems at chapter ends for example.

   - started this.  problem set 1 moved into place (not all of it fits, perhaps move 1a to appendix)
   - thought I'd work through problem sets, adding descriptions and makeproblem/answer env,
      and move into place along with the lecture notes ... 

      However, I can only find ps1 written up?

      Perhaps all the problem
      sets were ungraded and I only did them on paper (I have all those qmII notebooks ... 
      maybe I kept them because I intended to review what I'd done).
  
   - have two mathematica references in "phy456/problems/variationalHelium.tex" ... convert to nbref
   - delete most of the initial attempt garbage in "./problems/variationHarmonicOscillator.tex" and just leave the part where it's done right (perhaps with a comment about why the niave attempt doesn't work).

================================================================================================

PHY485
------

   - go through Fowles for the typos notes added to the appendix.

   - indexing is very sparse (with some stuff that should be nested under other more general headings)

   - undid the use of \fixme package because it messed up the hyperlinks in the index.  Consider restoring for private draft mode.
      The output of the \fixme markup was weird too in this book form.

================================================================================================

ALL:
- files copied with ORIG_FILES and ORIG_FRONTBACK_FILES don't have the right dependencies.  to update any of these have to make clean ; make (same issue with ../phy454/ (and many of the other makefiles that have ORIG_FILES rules)).

   - Acknowledgment:
      - send postcard to classicthesis sty creator as requested.  Include urls.

   - saw reference to a script that ships with Latex that does what my make_pdflatex does (running latex/bib/makeindex repeatedly until done).
     Look up what that was and see about switching to it.

   - a number of older notes compilations could be switched to \makeproblem/makeanswer format for solved problems.  Especially:

      classicalmechanics
      phy356
      phy450
      phy454
      phy456

   - any places left to switch to \makeoproblem{} to mark origin of problem?  (parts of) classicalmechanics and phy454 is done.  phy485 too?

   - now have a bunch of spots like Maxwell's equation \eqnref, where there's a named equation followed by a \cref that will also generate a eq.  -- search those out and change to a different command (probably something that uses a plain reference).

   - cref's for figures look different than those for equations.  Could pretty that up and make them consistent.

   - With an eye on consistency, should probably hunt down all plain \ref's and use commands that can be given consistent formatting.

   - http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/19104/cleveref-with-counters-with-same-name comments suggest that \input should not specify the suffix.  Why?

   - myBoxed{} often makes the space too big at the top.
