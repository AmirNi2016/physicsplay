- have some macros that are specific to individual docs (like the ones for my old cross product notes.)

   Move those to the appropriate thisbook.sty's

   A good start would be to identify dependencies.

- Had unnumbered equations in older latex sources

        Have scripted an update for the \[\] \begin{align}... \begin{align*}...

        using ~/bin/replaceOldStyleTexEquationMarkup

        Do the {equation*} ones too.

- make a macro for formatting eq. for references to external formula numbers.

- \makeproblem doesn't wrap lines for the description when it is too long (which often appears to be the case).

- have some coupled macro dependencies.  Should break these out, as done with macros_bm

   example: figures

- Exercises:
   - not entirely pleased with how the exercise environment ends up looking.  Could end up rewriting that using the latex templates sample.

- Examples:
   - add examples and problems to TOC and bookmarks.  Tried this in the \makeexample and \makeproblem commands, but it doesn't work right on second pass compilation. (note \makeexample is now using mdframed).

- A search for \href references to mathematica notebooks, and change those to
  links to a mathematica appendix:

        ./classicalmechanics/mine/infiniteSheetPotentials.tex:205:%\href{https://raw.github.com/peeterjoot/physicsplay/master/notes/phy354/.cdf}{this integral we find}
        ./phy456/problems/qmTwoPs4.tex:238:Attempting that calculation with \href{https://github.com/peeterjoot/physicsplay/blob/796c8e3739ae1a9ca26270a0e91384afba45661d/notes/phy456/problem\%20set\%204,\%20problem\%202.nb}{Mathematica} however, is deceiving, since Mathematica reports these all as zero after FullSimplify.  It appears, that as used, it does not allow for $m = n$ and $m = n \pm 1$ constraints properly where the denominators of the unsimplified integrals go zero.
        ./blogit/qmTwoExamReflection.tex:935:We did not have to calculate these, but just understand how the degeneracy splits.  Trying this problem after the exam, I found that the matrix element of the perturbation Hamiltonian was not diagonal in the way I had found writing the exam.  I did this \href{https://github.com/peeterjoot/physicsplay/blob/master/notes/phy456/qmTwoExamReflection.cdf}{exactly in Mathematica}.

Figures submodule:  figure out which figures are orphaned.

classicalmechanics:

   \text{Re} -> \Real

reviewed up to ~page 170 of classicalmechanics for () -> \lr{} stuff using:

   ,$ s/(\(.*\))/\\lr{ \1 }/cg

Notice that I've got some \left( ... \mathLabelBox{} ... \right) .  Change to \biglr{} [ ie. \Bigl( ... \Bigr) ]

- manual use of \Bigl( ... \Bigr) can now be changed to \biglr{}.  This will allow for Biggl changes more easily if desired.

================================================================================================

classicalmechanics/mathematica.tex
gabook/mathematica.tex
   - now added a filter for this mathematica.tex.  check the notebooks ...
     don't think any of them were used for figure generation (figures in
gabook appear to be mostly hand-drawn with a couple of them done using
gaviewer)

phy450/mathematica.tex
phy452/mathematica.tex
phy454/mathematica.tex
phy456/mathematica.tex
phy485/mathematica.tex

- Switch from imageFigure to mathImageFigure for mathematica generate notebooks to include a link to the notebook that generated it.

================================================================================================

Style checker:

- Look for unhandled {CAPTION} from figures.

- Be consistent about \text use in math mode.  \mathrm{} is often nicer.  Rule of thumb?  Use for x_{\text{}} locations, not for multiword text (such as if constraints in multiple option formulas)

- Look for common errors like cref{eqn: (instead of eqnref{eqn:) ... and for document local conventions like \Bx vs \vec{x} and _\nought vs. _0, _o, _\circ, ...

  \kB, \CV, ...

- look for \begin{aligned}...\end{aligned} with no alignment (& \\) markers.  Have a number of instances 
of this from scripted conversion of {align*} environments to {equation}\begin{aligned}...\end... 

- spelling: indexes -> indices

   perl -p -i -e 's/indexes/indices/g;' 
   perl -p -i -e 's/exersize/exercise/g;' -e 's/Exersize/Exercise/g;' `cat l`

================================================================================================

- files copied with ORIG_FILES and ORIG_FRONTBACK_FILES don't have the right dependencies.  to update any of these have to make clean ; make (same issue with ../phy454/ (and many of the other makefiles that have ORIG_FILES rules)).

   - Acknowledgment:
      - send postcard to classicthesis sty creator as requested.  Include urls.

   - saw reference to a script that ships with Latex that does what my make_pdflatex does (running latex/bib/makeindex repeatedly until done).
     Look up what that was and see about switching to it.

   - a number of older notes compilations could be switched to \makeproblem/makeanswer format for solved problems.  Especially:

      classicalmechanics
      phy356
      phy450
      phy454
      phy456

   - any places left to switch to \makeoproblem{} to mark origin of problem?  (parts of) classicalmechanics and phy454 is done.  phy485 too?

   - now have a bunch of spots like Maxwell's equation \eqnref, where there's a named equation followed by a \cref that will also generate a eq.  -- search those out and change to a different command (probably something that uses a plain reference).

   - cref's for figures look different than those for equations.  Could pretty that up and make them consistent.

   - With an eye on consistency, should probably hunt down all plain \ref's and use commands that can be given consistent formatting.

   - http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/19104/cleveref-with-counters-with-same-name comments suggest that \input should not specify the suffix.  Why?
