gabook
------

   - I had a TODO list for this notes collection.  Where did it go?

================================================================================================

miscphysics
-----------

   - review this collection.  Probably lots that should be done.

================================================================================================

classicalmechanics
------------------

   - solve and write up the other phy354 problem sets and the midterm and final.  problem set 2 i/p.  want to look at the E - q \phi and do a comparison between the relativistic and non-rel results to see how they compare for small v.

   - have at least one complete lecture on paper and some partially written up lecture notes to finish up and add here.

   - rework some mult part goldstein and tong problems in makesubquestion/subanswer format.

================================================================================================

phy356
------

   - switch to \makeproblem/makeanswer format for solved problems.

================================================================================================

phy450
------
   - Give this a re-read and see what state it is in.

   - don't think I ever did any figures for this class.  Probably too much work to retrofit them.

================================================================================================

phy454
------

   - Computational work:
      - attempt the problem to derive the compatibility condition.  Doing this should help resolve the issue of how the stress tensor can be applied.
      - coffee problem

   ===============

   - Indexing:
      ( http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Indexing )

      -- got the make rules done (standalone sample: ../latex/index.tex).
      -- now have to add all the index tags.  Grabbed all my wordpress keywords and saved them to: indexTags.txt.  Do a search for those expressions
         and add \index{} entries, perhaps automatically to start with (i.e. first reference).

      - have commented out the \printindex in phy454.tex and stubbed the \index command in mycommon.sty... to much work to go retrofit index
        tags everywhere!

   - Exercises:
      - not entirely pleased with how the exercise environment ends up looking.  Could end up rewriting that using the latex templates sample.
      - put links back to questions in the answers.
      - Can add paragraph headings to give titles to sub-Question answers.
         - had done that (\unnumberedSubsection command), but was seeing weird effects with section titles emitted later after the environment closed ... like before the text in the summary sections).  backed all that out for now and replaced with plain old text.
      - \ref{} markers for multi-part questions aren't showing up well.  Looks like mis-interaction with \paragraph{}.  Probably do something more systematic, labeling these references with
         Question #: Text

   - Visual:
      - graphical cover page (stirred cup of coffee;) would be nice.

   - Figures:
      - go through all figures and re-draw many.
      - can open with Sketchbook express, and then turn the initial drawing into a hidden layer, tracing the original.

   - Examples:
      - add examples and problems to TOC and bookmarks.  Tried this in the \makeexample and \makeproblem commands, but it doesn't work right on second pass compilation.
      - would be nice to introduce a background color box for examples (light color).  Have a rule instead for now.
         Example of how to do this: ../latex/tcolorbox.tex
            ( from http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/44833/math-inside-tables-and-formatting/44840#44840 )

   - Computational work:
      - attempt the extra optional homework from handouts/ClassNote17.pdf

   - Latex:
      - would be nice to have the bib and index show up as parts directly without having to have chapter headings in the parts (like the preface and contents).
         One solution would be to flatten the chapters and then remove the parts.  Especially now that I've got most of my worked problems moved into Q/A environments (to be moved along with the relevant material).

      (phy485 looks better in this respect)

      - Make \FIXME conditional on classicthesis drafting variable.
         (or switch to \fixme package as done in phy485 notes).

================================================================================================

phy456
------

   - would be nice to restructure to have a more systematic layout.  Put the various worked problems and notes from the readings as problems at chapter ends for example.

================================================================================================

PHY485
------

   - go through Fowles for the typos notes added to the appendix.

   - indexing is very sparse (with some stuff that should be nested under other more general headings)

   - undid the use of \fixme package because it messed up the hyperlinks in the index.  Consider restoring for private draft mode.
      The output of the \fixme markup was weird too in this book form.

PHY452
------

================================================================================================

ALL:

   - files copied with ORIG_FILES and ORIG_FRONTBACK_FILES don't have the right dependencies.  to update any of these have to make clean ; make
     (same issue with ../phy454/ (and many of the other makefiles that have ORIG_FILES rules)).

   - Acknowledgment:
      - send postcard to classicthesis sty creator as requested.  Include urls.

   - review the new use of \mathLabelBox's in:

      blogit

      ... see if any should be adjusted.

   - saw reference to a script that ships with Latex that does what my make_pdflatex does (running latex/bib/makeindex repeatedly until done).
     Look up what that was and see about switching to it.

   - Go through these dirs and see if there anything of substance left in them:

      notes/algebra
      notes/calculus
      notes/differential_forms
      notes/dynamics
      notes/geometric-algebra
      notes/toc

      (may have figures to move to their new positions).

   - a number of older notes compilations could be switched to \makeproblem/makeanswer format for solved problems.  Especially:

      classicalmechanics
      phy356
      phy450
      phy454
      phy456

   - any places left to switch to \makeoproblem{} to mark origin of problem?  (parts of) classicalmechanics and phy454 is done.  phy485 too?

   - have some stuff like (\cite{doran2003gap}) --- switch to \citep{}

   - any use of direct \includegraphics
