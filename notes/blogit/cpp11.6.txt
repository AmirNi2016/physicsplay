Chapter 31:

<h2>Emplace</h2>

I'd never heard the word emplace before, but it turns out that it isn't a word made up for c++, but is also a dictionary word

http://www.dictionary.com/browse/emplace

meaning to "put into place or position".

c++11 defines some emplace functions.  Here's an example for vector

[sourcecode language="cpp"]
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   using pair = std::pair<int, int> ;
   using vector = std::vector< pair > ;

   vector v ;

   pair p{ 1, 2 } ;
   v.push_back( p ) ;
   v.push_back( {2, 3} ) ;
   v.emplace_back( 3, 4 ) ;

   for ( auto e : v )
   {
      std::cout << e.first << ", " << e.second << '\n' ;
   }

   return 0 ;
}
[/sourcecode]

The emplace_back is like the push_back function, but does not require that a constructed object be created first, either explicitly as in the object p above, or implictly as done with the {2, 3} pair initializer list.
