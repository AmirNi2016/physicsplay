\makeproblem{Temperature dependent carrier density of a doped semiconductor}{condensedMatter:problemSet10:2}{ 
Germanium has an energy gap of E C - E V = 0.67 eV, and an intrinsic carrier density
n i = 2.5 × 10 19 m -3 at room temperature. A sample of germanium is doped with ar-
senic, which has a donor level located at E d = 0.0127 eV below E C . The concentration
of arsenic atoms is N D = 1.0 × 10 22 m -3 .

Show the temperature dependence of the carrier density in this sample by drawing a
plot of ln(n) vs. 1/T, between 1 K and 293 K (room temperature), and a second plot
covering the temperature range from 100 K to 1000 K. Explain the main features of
the plots.
