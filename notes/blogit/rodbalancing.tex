In pr 1.x of \citep{sakurai2014modern} we are asked for the time before a very thin rod balancing on its tip will fall if the rod stability is constrained by the uncertainty principle.

Suppose the rod has mass \( M \) and length \( L \).  The mass of a small segment of the rod at height \( y \) is \( dM = \rho A dy \), and has potential energy

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:rodbalancing:20}
dE
= dM g y 
= \rho A y dy.
\end{dmath}

The total potential energy of the rod is

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:rodbalancing:40}
E 
= g \int_0^L \rho A y dy
= g \rho A \frac{L^2}{2}
= g \frac{M}{L} \frac{L^2}{2}
= \frac{g M L}{2}.
\end{dmath}

Using \( \Delta E \Delta t \ge \frac{\Hbar}{2} \), we can say that the time before the rod moves would be approximately

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:rodbalancing:60}
\Delta t 
= \frac{\Hbar}{2} \frac{2}{g M L}
= \frac{\Hbar}{g M L}.
\end{dmath}

Alternately, given a circular area profile, diameter \( D \), density \( \rho \) and length \( L \), this time is

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:rodbalancing:n}
\Delta 
= 
\frac{4 \Hbar}{g \rho \pi D^2 L^2 }.
\end{dmath}

For a rod (chopstick) of mass \( 10 \si{g} \), length \( 9.5" = 0.24 m \), \( g = 9.8 \si{m/s^2} \) and \( \Hbar = 10^{-34} \si{m^2 kg/s} \), this is an infinitesimal time

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:rodbalancing:n}
\Delta t = 10^{-32} \si{s}
\end{dmath}

For a fragment of human hair with density \( \rho = 1300 \si{kg/m^3} \), diameter \( D = 6 \times 10^{-5} m \), and length \( 0.2 \si{mm} = 2 \times 10^{-4} \si{m} \), this time is increased to

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:rodbalancing:n}
\Delta t = 10^{-21} \si{s},
\end{dmath}

which is still tiny.  There's a few options, one of which is that the uncertainty principle alone cannot be used in isolation to determine the stability of such a system, and another is that this crude energy-time uncertainty is not specific enough.  With the estimate above, clearly the scales much be reduced drastically to gain larger stability times.
