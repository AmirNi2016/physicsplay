\makeproblem{Systematic trends in the Debye temperature}{condensedMatter:problemSet5:2}{ 
%:} (worth 5 marks)
Table 5.1 on page 
120 of Ibach and Luth shows the Debye temperature for  
various solids.  Discuss and explain any trends that you see in the Debye 
temperature, e.g.\ as a function of location in the periodic table, 
bonding type, or atomic mass.

\makeanswer{condensedMatter:problemSet5:2}{ 

The plot of Debye temperatures by atomic number can be found in \cref{fig:DebyeTemperaturesVsAtomicNumber:DebyeTemperaturesVsAtomicNumberFig1}.  This is based on data from \citep{knowledgedoor:debye}, and \citep{ibach2009solid}
