\makeproblem{Phonons in two dimensions}{basicStatMech:problemSet7:3}{ 

Consider phonons (quanta of lattice vibrations) which obey a dispersion relation

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:basicStatMechProblemSet7Problem3:20}
E_\Bk = \hbar v \Abs{\Bk}
\end{equation}

for small momenta $\Abs{\Bk}$, where $v$ is the speed of sound. Assuming a two-dimensional crystal, phonons only propagate along the plane containing the atoms. Find the specific heat of this crystal due to phonons at low temperature. Recall that phonons are not conserved, so there is no chemical potential associated with maintaining a fixed phonon density.
