\makeproblem{Estimating the BEC transition temperature}{basicStatMech:problemSet7:2}{ 
\makesubproblem{}{basicStatMech:problemSet7:2a}

Find data for the atomic mass of liquid ${}^4$ He and its density at ambient atmospheric pressure and hence estimate its BEC temperature assuming interactions are unimportant (even though this assumption is a very bad one!). For dilute atomic gases of the sort used in Professor Thywissen's lab, one typically has a cloud of $10^6$ atoms confined to an approximate cubic region with linear dimension 1 $\mu\,m$.
\makesubproblem{}{basicStatMech:problemSet7:2b}
Find the density - it is pretty low, so interactions can be assumed to be extremely weak.

\makesubproblem{}{basicStatMech:problemSet7:2c}

Assuming these are ${}^{87}$ Rb atoms, estimate the BEC transition temperature.
