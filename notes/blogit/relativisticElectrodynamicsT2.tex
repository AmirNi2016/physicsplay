\section{What we will discuss.}

\begin{itemize}
\item 4-vectors: position, velocity, acceleration
\item non-inertial observers
\end{itemize}

\section{Problem 1.}

A particle moves on the x-axis along a world line described by 

\begin{align}\label{eqn:relativisticElectrodynamicsT2:n}
ct(\sigma) &= \inv{a} \sinh(\sigma) \\
x(\sigma) &= \inv{a} \cosh(\sigma) 
\end{align}

where the dimensions of the constant $[a] = \inv{L}$, is inverse length, and $-\infty < \sigma < \infty$.

Find $x^i(\tau)$, $u^i(\tau)$, $a^i(\tau)$.

\cosh(\sigma) = \sqrt{1 + \sinh^2(\sigma)} = \sqrt{ 1 + (act)^2 } = a \sqrt{ 1/a^2 + (ct)^2 }

x(\sigma) = \sqrt{ 1/a^2 + (ct)^2 } \implies x^2 - (ct)^2 = 1/a^2

s_{12}^2 = (ct(\sigma_1) - ct(\sigma_2))^2 - (x(\sigma_1) - x(\sigma_2))^2 
= ... 
= 2/a^2 \cosh( \sigma_2 - \sigma_1) -1) \ge 0

(timelike)

dt^2 = ds^2/c^2 = d(x^0)^2 - d(x^1)^2 
= a^{-2} \cosh2 \sigma d\sigma^2 - am2 \sinh^2 \sigma d\sigma^2

d\tau^2 = am2/c^2 d\sigma^2 \implies

d\tau = am1/c \sigma + \tau_s

(let \tau_s = 0)

% am1 = 1/a am2 = 1/a^2
x^i(\tau) = ( am1 \sinh( a c \tau), am1 \cosh( a c \tau ), 0, 0 )

graph it: 

a hyperboloid, with aspemptote 1 (ie: approaching the speed of light).

u^i 
&= \frac{dx^i}{d\tau} \\
&= c ( \cosh( a c \tau ), \sinh( a c \tau ), 0, 0) \\

Is is light like?  

u \cdot u = c^2 ?

u \cdot u = c^2 ( \cosh^2 - \sinh^2 ) = c^2

Yes, it is lightlike.

Q: he didn't actually end up showing the asempt. approaches one.  Do this.


Let's calculate 

v^\alpha 
&= \frac{dx^\alpha}{dt} 
&=
\frac{dx^\alpha}{d\tau} \frac{d\tau}{dt}

\frac{dt}{d\tau}
&= \inv{c} \frac{dx^0}{d\tau} \\
&= \inv{c} \frac{d}{d\tau} \left( am1 \sinh( a c \tau ) \right)
&= \cosh( a c \tau ) 

So we have
v^1
&=
c \frac{ \sinh( a c \tau ) }{ \cosh( a c \tau) }
&=
c \tanh( a c \tau) 

w^i (\tau) 
&=
\frac{ du^i }{d\tau}  \\
&= a^2 c^2 x^i(\tau)

w \cdot w &= a^2 c^2 am1 (-1)

w \cdot u = 0 % FIXME: details.

The three acceleration

w^1 
&= \frac{dv^1}{dt} 
&= \frac{dv^1}{d\tau} \frac{d \tau}{dt}
&= \frac{1/\cosh^2}{\cosh}

CHECK THIS.

Summarizing

boxed.
x^i(\tau) &= ( am1 \sinh( a c \tau), am1 \cosh( a c \tau ), 0, 0 ) \\
u^i &= c ( \cosh( a c \tau ), \sinh( a c \tau ), 0, 0) \\
u^\alpha &= ( c \tanh( a c \tau) , 0, 0 )
w^i (\tau) &= a^2 c^2 x^i(\tau)

\section{Problem 2.  Local observers.}

Observations are made of either the three-vector, or the time like components of four-vectors, since these are the quantities that we can measure from our local observer frame.  This is something that can be viewed in an approximate sense as being inertial, provided that we ignore the earth's rotation, the rotation around the solar system, the rotation of the solar system in the galaxy, the rotation of the galaxy in the local cluster, and so forth.  Provided none of these are changing too fast relative to our measurements, we can make the inertial approximation.

Example.  If we want to measure energy, it is the timelike component of the momentum.

E = c p^0

PICTURE:  Let's imagine a moving worldline in three dimensions.  We can setup a frame and associated basis for the moving frame

Each observer sets up an orthonormal basis

{ e^i_ahat } that describes spacetime.

i = 0... 3 compoents


e_ohat^i = u^i_observer / c

going back to the first problem for u^i  we have

e^i_ohat = ( \cosh( a c t ), \sinh( a c t) , 0, 0 )
e^i_1hat = ( \sinh( a c t ), \cosh( a c t), 0, 0)
e^i_2hat = 0, 0, 1, 0
e^i_3hat = 0, 0, 0, 1

p^0 = p \cdot x^0

E_obs = c p \cdot e_ohat \equiv c p^ohat

In the observers reference frame

p^i' = (mc,0, 0, 0)

u^i'_obs = c \gamma (( 1, v/c , 0, 0)

u^i_obj c (1, 0, 0, 0)

u_obs^i' = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\gamma & \gamma v/c  & 0 & 0 \\
\gamma v/c  & \gamma  & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}

p^ohat = \gamma m c

Suppose we have a star far away.  What is the frequency of the light emmitted

\hat{\omega} = \omega e^{- a c \tau }

where \omega is the emitted frequency.
