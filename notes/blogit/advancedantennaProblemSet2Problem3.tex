\makeproblem{Far field electric field away from sources.}{advancedantenna:problemSet2:3}{ 

Show that in a region of space where there are no sources, the electric field dervied from the magnetic vector potential is given by the expression:

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:advancedantennaProblemSet2Problem3:20}
\BE = \inv{j \omega \epsilon_0 \mu_0 } \spacegrad \cross \lr{\spacegrad \cross \BA}.
\end{dmath}
