\makeproblem{Binomial distribution for biased coin}{basicStatMech:problemSet1:2}{ 
Consider the more general case of a binomial distribution where the probability of a head is $r$ and a tail is $(1 - r)$ (a biased coin).  With $\text{head} = -1$ and $\text{tail} = +1$, obtain the binomial distribution $P_N(r,X)$ for obtaining a total of $X$ from $N$ coin tosses.  What is the limiting form of this distribution when $N \gg 1$ and $\Abs{X} \ll N$?
