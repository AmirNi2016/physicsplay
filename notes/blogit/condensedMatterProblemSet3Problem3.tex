\makeproblem{Ewald construction for a two-dimensional lattice}{condensedMatter:problemSet3:3}{ 
%(Based on question 3.4 in Ibach and Luth.)
Show that the reciprocal lattice of a
two-dimensional lattice can be represented by rods.  Discuss the
Ewald construction for diffraction from a two-dimensional lattice
and determine the diffracted beam for a particular orientation and
magnitude of $\Bk_\circ$.  (It helps to draw a three-dimensional
diagram showing the plane of the reciprocal lattice, the rods, and
the Ewald sphere.)

Explain why you always see a diffraction pattern from a two-dimensional
crystal, provided that the magnitude of $\Bk_\circ$ exceeds a
critical value, regardless of its orientation.
