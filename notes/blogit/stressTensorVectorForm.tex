\section{Motivation.}

Exersize 6.1 from \cite{acheson1990elementary} is to show that the traction vector can be written in vector form (a rather curious thing to have to say) as

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:stressTensorVectorForm:10}
\Bt = -p \Bn + \mu ( 2 ( \Bn \cdot \spacegrad + \Bn \cross (\spacegrad \cross \Bu)).
\end{equation}

Note that the text uses a wedge symbol for the cross product, and I've switched to standard notation.  I've done so because the use of a Geometric-Algebra wedge product also can be used to express this relationship, in which case we would write

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:stressTensorVectorForm:30}
\Bt = -p \Bn + \mu ( 2 ( \Bn \cdot \spacegrad - \Bn \cdot (\spacegrad \wedge \Bu)).
\end{equation}

In either case we have

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:stressTensorVectorForm:50}
\Bn \cdot (\spacegrad \wedge \Bu)
= 
-\Bn \cross (\spacegrad \cross \Bu)
=
(\Bn \cdot \spacegrad) \Bu -
\spacegrad' (\Bn \cdot \Bu')
\end{equation}

(where the primes indicate the scope of the gradient, showing here that we are operating only on $\Bu$, and not $\Bn$).

After computing this, lets also compute the stress tensor in cylindrical and spherical coordinates, something that this allows us to do fairly easily without having to deal with the second order terms that we encountered doing this by computing the difference of squared displacements.
