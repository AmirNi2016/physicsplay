\makeproblem{Fcc reciprocal lattice}{condensedMatter:problemSet3:2}{ 
\makesubproblem{}{condensedMatter:problemSet3:2a}
Now for a face-centred cubic lattice with conventional unit cell 
  of side length $a$: 
  draw the conventional unit cell and number 
  all of the corner and face-centred atoms, and demonstrate that the vectors 
  $\Ba_1 = \frac{a}{2}(1,1,0)$, 
  $\Ba_2 = \frac{a}{2}(1,0,1)$ and 
  $\Ba_1 = \frac{a}{2}(0,1,1)$, are primitive lattice vectors 
  in the sense that you can get to every lattice point in the unit 
  cell using these vectors. 

\makesubproblem{}{condensedMatter:problemSet3:2b}
Using the formula from the lectures show that the volume of the 
  primitive unit cell is 1/4 of the volume of the conventional unit cell.

\makesubproblem{}{condensedMatter:problemSet3:2c}
Using the formula from the lectures,  find the basis vectors of 
  the corresponding reciprocal lattice, 
  and show that these basis vectors generate a body-centred-cubic 
  lattice in reciprocal space.
