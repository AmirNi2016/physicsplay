\makeproblem{Symmetric cavity}{modernOptics:problemSet4:3}{ 
Consider the lowest-order mode ($u_{00}$) of a symmetric cavity with length $L$ and mirror radius $R=R_1=R_2$. Let's choose the mirror radius to match the wavefront curvature of the gaussian beam.

\makesubproblem{Beam parameter}{modernOptics:problemSet4:3a}
%{\bf (a)} 
Find the beam parameter $z_0$ in terms of $L$ and $R$. You should find that for the particular case of a confocal cavity, $z_0 = L/2 = R/2$. 

\makesubproblem{Beam waist}{modernOptics:problemSet4:3b}
%{\bf (b)}
Find the beam waist for a general cavity, in terms of $L$, $R$, and $\lambda$. Do you notice anything strange for the conencentric cavity, $R=L/2$ ? For the confocal case, you should find that $w_o = L/k$. 

\makesubproblem{Harmonic frequency in cavity}{modernOptics:problemSet4:3c}
%{\bf (c)}
Following the analogy to the 2D harmonic oscillator constructed in class, see if you can show that a confocal cavity provides an effective harmonic frequency of $\omega_{\mathrm{osc}} = 2 c/L$. {\em (Two hints: 1, Look up the form of the ground state of the harmonic oscillator and compare to our gaussian mode at its waist; and 2, You'll need to use the effective mass we derived in class, $m_{\mathrm{eff}} = \hbar k/c$.)}
