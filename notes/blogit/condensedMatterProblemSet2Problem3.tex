\makeproblem{Lattice vectors, primitive vs. conventional unit cell}{condensedMatter:problemSet2:3}{ 

A crystal has a basis of one atom per lattice point and 
a set of primitive translation vectors is 

\begin{eqnarray*}
\Ba = 3\xcap \qquad \Bb = 3\ycap \qquad 
\Bc = 1.5(\xcap + \ycap + \zcap), 
\end{eqnarray*}

where $\xcap$, $\ycap$ and $\zcap$ are the 
unit vectors in the x,y and z directions. 

Assume that the dimensions are Angstroms, \AA.

What is the lattice type of this crystal, what is the 
volume of the primitive unit cell, and what is the volume of 
the conventional unit cell?
