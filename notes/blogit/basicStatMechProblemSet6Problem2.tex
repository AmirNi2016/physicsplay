The theory of the ideal Fermi or Bose gases often involves integrals of the form
f±
?(z) =
1
G(?)
Z8
0
dx
x?-1
z-1ex± 1
where G(?) =R8
0dyy?-1e-ydenotes the gamma function. Obtain the behavior of f±
?(z) for z ? 0 keeping the two
leading terms in the expansion. For fermions, obtain the behavior of f+
?(z) for z ? 8 again keeping the two leading
terms. For bosons, we must have z = 1 (why?), obtain the leading term of f-
?(z) for z ? 1.
