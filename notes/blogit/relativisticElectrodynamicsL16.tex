\section{Reading.}

Covering chapter 6 material from the text \cite{landau1980classical}.

Covering \href{http://www.physics.utoronto.ca/~poppitz/e-poppitz/PHY450_files/RelEMpp115-127.pdf}{lecture notes pp. 115-127}: properties of monochromatic plane EM waves (122-124); energy and energy flux of the EM field and energy conservation from the equations of motion (125-127)  [Wednesday, Mar. 2]

\section{Review.  Solution to the wave equation.}

Recall that in the Coulobm gauge

\begin{align}\label{eqn:relativisticElectrodynamicsL15:10}
A^0 &= 0 \\
\spacegrad \cdot \BA &= 0 \\
\end{align}

our equation to solve is

\left( \inv{c^2} \PDSq{t}{} - \Delta \right) \BA &= 0.

We found that the general solution was

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:relativisticElectrodynamicsL15:730}
\BA(\Bx, t) = \int \frac{d^3\Bk}{(2 \pi)^3} \left( 
e^{i (\Bk \cdot \Bx + \omega_k t)} \Bbeta^\conj(-\Bk)
+e^{i (\Bk \cdot \Bx - \omega_k t)} \Bbeta(\Bk)
\right)
\end{equation}

where 

\Bk \cdot \BBeta(\Bk) = 0

It is clear that this is a solution since 

\left( \inv{c^2} \PDSq{t}{} - \Delta \right) e^{i (\Bk \cdot \Bx + \omega_k t)} = 0

\section{Moving to physically relavant results.}

Since the most generral solution is a sum over $\Bk$, it is enough to consider only a single $\Bk$, or equivalently, take

\Bbeta(\Bk) &= \Bbeta ( 2\pi)^3 \delta^3(\Bk - \Bp) \\
\Bbeta^\conj(-\Bk) &= \Bbeta^\conj ( 2\pi)^3 \delta^3(-\Bk - \Bp)

but we have the freedom to pick a real and constant $\Bbeta$.  Now our solution is

\BA(\Bx, t) = \Bbeta \left( 
e^{-i (\Bp \cdot \Bx + \omega_k t)} 
+e^{i (\Bp \cdot \Bx - \omega_k t)} 
\right)
= \Bbeta \cos( \omega t - \Bp \cdot \Bx)

where

\BBeta \cdot \Bp = 0

DIY: show that also using $\Bbeta$ complex also works.

Let's choose 

\Bp = (p, 0, 0)

Since
\Bp \cdot \BBeta = p_x \beta_x

we must have

\BBeta_x = 0

so 

\Bbeta = (0, \beta_y, \beta_z)

Note that the Coulomb gauge \spacegrad \cdot BA = 0 implies that there are two linearly indepentent choices of $\Bbeta$ and $\Bp$

PICTURE: 

\Beta_1, \Beta_2, \Bp all mutually perpendicular.

\BE 
&= -\PD{ct}{\BA}  \\
&= -\frac{\Bbeta}{c} \PD{t}{} \cos(\omega t - \Bp \cdot \Bx) \\
&= -\inv{c} \Bbeta \omega_p 
\sin(\omega t - \Bp \cdot \Bx)

(recall: $\omega_p = c\Abs{\Bp}$)

%boxed

\BE = \Beta \Abs{\Bp} \sin(\omega t - \Bp \cdot \Bx) 

\BB 
&= \spacegrad \cross \BA \\
&= \spacegrad \cross ( \Bbeta \cos(\omega t - \Bp \cdot \Bx) \\
&= (\spacegrad \cos(\omega t - \Bp \cdot \Bx)) \cross \Bbeta \\
&= \sin(\omega t - \Bp \cdot \Bx) \Bp \cross \Bbeta 

%boxed
\BB = (\Bp \cross \Beta) \sin(\omega t - \Bp \cdot \Bx) 

Example:

$\Bp \parallel \Be_x$
$\BB \parallel \Be_y \text{or} \Be_z$

(since we have two linearly indepenendent choices)

Example: 1

take $\Bbeta \parallel \Be_y$

\BE &= \Beta p \sin(c p t - p x)  \\
\BB &= (\Bp \cross \Beta) \sin(c p t - p x) 

At $t = 0$
\BE &= -\Beta p \sin( p x)  \\
%\BB &= -(\Bp \cross \Beta) \sin(p x) 
B_z &= - \Abs{\Beta} \Be_z c p \sin(p x)

PICTURE: 
two oscillating mutually perpendicular sinusoids.

So physically, we see that $\Bp$ is the direction of propagation.  We have always

\Bp \perp \BE

and we have two possible polarizations.

Convention is usually to take the direction of oscillation of $\BE$ the polarization of the wave.

This is the starting point for the field of optics, because the polarization of the incident wave, is strongly tied to how much of the wave will reflect off of a surface with a given index of refraction $n$.

\section{EM waves carrying energy and momentum}

Maxwell field in vacuum is the sum of plane monochromatic waves, two per wave vector.

PICTURE:

\BE &\parallel \Be_3 \\
\BB &\parallel \Be_1 \\
\Bk &\parallel \Be_2

PICTURE:

\BB &\parallel -\Be_3 \\
\BE &\parallel \Be_1 \\
\Bk &\parallel \Be_2

(two linearly independent polarizations)

Our wave frequency is

\omega_{\Bk} = c \Abs{\Bk}

The wavelength, the value such that $x \rightarrow x + \frac{2 \pi}{k}$

DIY: see:
\sin(k c t - k x)

\lambda_{\Bk} = \frac{2 \pi}{k}

period

T = \frac{ 2 \pi} {k c} = \frac{\lambda_\Bk}{c} 


\subsection{}

Reminder:

Energy conservation from equations of motion

m \ddot{x} = - U'(x)

m \dot{x} \ddot{x} = - \dot{x} U'(x)

m \ddt{ \frac{m \dot{x}^2}{2} } = - \ddt{ U(x) }

\ddt{} \left( \frac{m \xdot^2}{2} - U(x) \right) = 0

\paragraph{Task:} Do this for Maxwell's equations
