\section{Motivation}

In \citep{pathriastatistical} problem 2.2, it's suggested to try a spherical change of vars to verify explicitly that phase space volume is preserved, and to explore some related ideas.  As a first step let's try a similar, but presumably easier change of variables, going from Cartesian to cylindrical phase spaces.
