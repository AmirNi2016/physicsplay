\chapter{Believed to be typos in Desai's QM Text}

\beginArtNoToc

Vatche says that the root cause of what I've identified as a typo is in some cases incorrect, and that he's going through the text carefully himself too.

\section{Chapter I.}

\begin{itemize}
\item Page 7.  Text before (1.43).  $\alpha$ instead of $a$ used.
\item Page 19.  Equation (1.122).  $\dagger$s omitted after first equality.
\end{itemize}

\section{Chapter II.}
\begin{itemize}
\item Page 40.  Text before (2.137).  Reference to equation (2.133) should be (2.135)
\item Page 53.  Is the "Also show that" here correct?  I get a different answer.
\end{itemize}

\section{Chapter III.}
\begin{itemize}
\item Page 61.  Equation (3.51).  $1/\hbar$ missing.
\item Page 66.  Equation (3.92).  $-(d/dt \bra{\alpha}) \ket{\alpha}$ should be $+\ket{\alpha} d/dt \bra{\alpha}$.
\item Page 66.  Equation (3.93).  $H$ on wrong side of $\bra{\alpha}$ 
\end{itemize}

\section{Chapter IV.}
\begin{itemize}
\item Page 81.  Equation (4.52).  Should be $-2\alpha$ in the exponent.
\item Page 82.  Equation (4.67).  $2\alpha$ in the denominator of the normalization should be $\alpha'/\pi$.
\item Page 83.  Equation (4.74).  A normalized wave function isn't required for the discussion, but if that was intended, a $1/\sqrt{2\pi}$ factor is missing.
\item Page 86.  Equation (4.99).  Extra brace in the exponent.
\item Page 87.  Equation (4.106).  Extra brace in the exponent.
\item Page 89.  Equation (4.129), (4.130).  $\lambda - m^2/...$ should be $\lambda + ...$
\item Page 93.  Equation (4.169).  conjugation missing for $Y_{lm}$.  $Y_{l'm'}$ is missing prime on the $l$ index.
\item Page 95.  Second line of text.  Language choice?  "We now implement".  perhaps utilize would be better?
\item Page 95.  Text before (4.193).  $i$ is in bold.
\item Page 96.  Text before (4.196).  $i$ is in bold.
\item Page 97.  (4.205).  $i$ is in bold.
\item Page 97.  (4.207-209).  $\Bi$, and $\Bj$s aren't in bold like $\Bk$
\item Page 101.  (4.239-240).  The approach here is unclear.  FIXME: incorporate lecture notes from class that did this using braket notation.
\item Page 102.  (4.248-249).  Commas missing to separate $l$, and $m\pm 1$ in the kets.
\end{itemize}

\section{Chapter V.}
\begin{itemize}
\item Page 113.  (5.86). One $\sigma$ isn't in bold.
\item Page 114.  (5.100). $\chi$ is in bold.
\item Page 115.  Text before (5.106). $\alpha$ in bold.
\item Page 118.  Switch of notation in problem 5 for ensemble averages.  $[S_i]$ used instead of $\expectation{S_i}_{\text{av}}$.
\end{itemize}

\section{Chapter VI.}
\begin{itemize}
\item Page 120.  $\phi$ in bold.  $A$ not in bold.
\item Page 123.  (6.26).  $1/i \hbar$ factor missing on RHS.
\item Page 124.  Text before (6.37).  You say canonical momenta $P_k$, but call these mechanical momenta on prev page.
\item Page 125.  (6.41).  Some $\psi$s are in bold.
\item Page 126.  (6.49).  There's no mention that $\BB$ is constant, leaving it unclear how the gauge condition and how the curl of $\BA$ reproduces $\BB$.  This would also help clarify how you are able to write $\Bmu \cdot \BB = \BB \cdot \Bmu$.
\item Page 128.  (6.65).  $\Bmu \cdot \BL$ should be $\Bmu \cdot \BB$.
\item Page 129.  (6.75).  $\Bmu \cdot \BL$ should be $\Bmu \cdot \BB$.
\end{itemize}
