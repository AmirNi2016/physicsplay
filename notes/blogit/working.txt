The dot product between two bivectors $A$, $B$ will also be used, defined as the scalar part of the product $AB$.  In particular the identity for extraction of that scalar component from the dot product of two wedge products will be required

(a \wedge b ) \cdot (c \wedge d)
= ( a (b \cdot c) - b ( a \cdot c) ) \cdot d
= (a \cdot d) (b \cdot c) - (b \cdot d) ( a \cdot c)
