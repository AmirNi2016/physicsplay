The dot product between two bivectors $A$, $B$ will also be used, defined as the scalar part of the product $AB$.  In particular the identity for extraction of that scalar component from the dot product of two wedge products will be required

(a \wedge b ) \cdot (c \wedge d)
= ( a (b \cdot c) - b ( a \cdot c) ) \cdot d
= (a \cdot d) (b \cdot c) - (b \cdot d) ( a \cdot c) 

Following up on the previous thought, it is not hard to come up with an example of a symmetric tensor a whole lot simpler than the electrodynanmic stress tensor.  The metric tensor is probably the simplest symmetric tensor, and we get that by considering the dot product of two vectors.  Taking the dot product of vectors $a$ and $b$ for example we have

a \cdot b 
= a^\mu b^\nu \gamma_\mu \cdot \gamma_\nu

From this, the metric tensor is defined as

\eta_{\mu\nu} = \gamma_\mu \cdot \gamma_\nu

This can be seen to be symmetric and diagonal.

Let's look at the transformation of the dot product, utilizing the transformation of the four vectors being dotted to do so.  By definition, when both vectors are equal, we have the (squared) spacetime interval, which based on the speed of light being constant, has been found to be an invariant under transformation.

a' \cdot b'
= 
a^\mu b^\nu L(\gamma_\mu) \cdot L(\gamma_\nu)

... finish.
