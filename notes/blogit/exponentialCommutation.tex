\section{Motivation.}

Previously while working a Liboff problem, I wondered about what the conditions were required for exponentials to commute.  In those problems the exponential arguments were operators.  Exponentials of bivectors as in quaternion like spatial or Lorentz boosts are also good examples of (sometimes) non-commutative exponentials.  It appears likely that the key requirement is that the exponential arguments commute, but how does one show this?  Here this is explored a bit.

\section{Guts}

If one could show that it was true that

\begin{align}\label{eqn:exponentialCommutation:1}
e^{x} e^{y} = e^{x + y}.
\end{align}

Then it would also imply that 

\begin{align}\label{eqn:exponentialCommutation:2}
e^{x} e^{y} = e^{y} e^{x}.
\end{align}

Let's perform the school boy exersize to prove \ref{eqn:exponentialCommutation:1} and explore the restrictions for such a proof.  We assume a power series definition of the exponential operator, and do not assume the values $x,y$ are numeric, instead just that they can be multiplied.  A commutative multiplication will not be assumed.

By virtue of the power series exponential definition we have

\begin{align}\label{eqn:exponentialCommutation:3}
e^{x} e^{y} = 
\sum_{k=0}^\infty \inv{k!} x^k
\sum_{m=0}^\infty \inv{m!} y^m.
\end{align}

To attempt to put this into $e^{x + y}$ form we'll need to change the order that we evaluate the double sum, and here a picture (\ref{fig:gridSummation}) is helpful.

\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[totalheight=0.4\textheight]{gridSummation}
\caption{Double sum diagonal ordering}\label{fig:gridSummation}
\end{figure}

If we label each diagonal with index $j$, and points on that subset with $n=0,1,\cdots, j$, we have

\begin{align}\label{eqn:exponentialCommutation:4}
k &= j - n \\
m &= n,
\end{align}

so our sum becomes

\begin{align}\label{eqn:exponentialCommutation:5}
e^{x} e^{y} = 
\sum_{j=0}^\infty \sum_{n=0}^j
\inv{(j-n)!} x^{j-n}
\inv{n!} y^n.
\end{align}

One small rearrangement, and the goal is almost reached, or would be if $x$ and $y$ were commuting numeric values

\begin{align}\label{eqn:exponentialCommutation:6}
e^{x} e^{y} = 
\sum_{j=0}^\infty \inv{j!} \sum_{n=0}^j \frac{j!}{(j-n)! n!} x^{j-n} y^n.
\end{align}

Observe that the interior sum is now the binomial expansion of $(x + y)^j$, and reduce the problem to a considering what the implication of possible non-commuation have on the binomial expansion.  Consider the simple special case of $(x + y)^2$.  If $x$ and $y$ do not neccessarily commute, then we have

\begin{align}\label{eqn:exponentialCommutation:7}
(x + y)^2 = x^2 + x y + y x + y^2
\end{align}

whereas the binomial expansion formula has no such allowance for non-commutative multiplication and just counts the number of times a product can occur in any ordering as in

\begin{align}\label{eqn:exponentialCommutation:8}
(x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2 x y + y^2 = x^2 + 2 y x + y^2.
\end{align}

One sees the built in requirement for commutative multiplication here.  Now this doesn't prove that $e^{x} e^{y} != e^{y} e^{x}$ unconditionally if $x$ and $y$ do not commute, but we do see that a requirement for commutative multiplication is sufficient if we want equality of such commuted exponentials.  In particular, the end result of the Liboff calculation where we had

\begin{align}\label{eqn:exponentialCommutation:9}
e^{i \hat{f}} e^{-i \hat{f}},
\end{align}

and was assuming this to be unity even for the differential operators $\hat{f}$ under consideration is now completely answered (since we have $(i \hat{f}) (-i \hat{f}) \psi = (-i \hat{f}) (i \hat{f}) \psi$).
