\makeproblem{Polarization power loss.}{advancedantenna:problemSet1:4}{ 
Transmitting and receiving antennas operating at 1 \si{GHz} have gains of 20 and 15 \si{dB}
respectively and are separated by a distance of 1 \si{km}. Find the power delivered to a
matched load when the input power is 150 \si{W} and when
\makesubproblem{}{advancedantenna:problemSet1:4a}
both antennas are polarization matched.
\makesubproblem{}{advancedantenna:problemSet1:4b}
One antenna is lineraly polarized and the other is circularly polarized.
