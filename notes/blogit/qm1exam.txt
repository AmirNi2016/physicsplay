PHY356 Exam notes:

- I messed up on part of question 3 ... it occurred to me later how
the measurement of the L_z and L^2 would effect the outcomes, and why,
but in the rush of trying to finish I wrote that the probabilities for
those would be the same.
- I botched part of question 4 in my rush (calculating the
differential equation for L(rho), something that I'd even done before,
as self assigned homework, at a more leisurely pace).  I also didn't
get a chance to explain the convergence issues (the constraints on L).
 It occurred to me later that I should have at least stated that they
existed, even if I'd done so without showing why.
- I hardly had a chance to start question 5.  I'm pretty sure I know
how to proceed with the solution, but didn't have a chance.




Q1) from [x,p] = i hbar derive: <x' | P | x>

and explain the physical meaning.

[ first part straight from the text ].

Q2) A standard question on spin states.

calculate the max for:

< \phi | S_y | \phi >

given an initial 

\phi = N ( \z+ + b \z-)

and a specific hamiltonian (forget what exactly).

Calculate that expectation itself and discuss consistency with the max question.

Q3) given a state

\phi = 
\sqrt{1/7} \ket{ 12 }
\sqrt{2/7} \ket{ 10 }
\sqrt{4/7} \ket{ 20 }

(or something like it), and a Hamiltonian

H = \alpha L_z

calculate the evolved state.

what are the probabilities of the outcomes for a measurement of L_z at this
time.

What are the probabilities for the outcomes for a measurement of L^2 after this.

what I failed to clue into here was that the outcomes are the eigenvalues
so for the degenerate states and measurement of L_z, the outcomes will be
m hbar = 0, or 2

This should effect the probabilities accordingly, and also suspect it should
effect the probabilities of the subsequent L^2 measurement.

I wasted time here trying to recall the spin rotation relations for L_z.
I believe they weren't required.

Q4) .... reiteration of L(rho) derivation straight from the text.

Q5: a) calculate X_H and P_H.  Believe that the sandwich exponential relations
would be required (although they were not listed in the given formulas).

b) a specific question about the specific states given

\psi = a \ket{1} + b \ket{2} 

I forget what the question was, and didn't get a chance to attempt it.
