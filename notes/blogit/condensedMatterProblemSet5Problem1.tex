\makeproblem{Density of states of a 1-d chain}{condensedMatter:problemSet5:1}{ 
Calculate and sketch a plot of the density of states, $Z(\omega)$, for 
the vibrational modes of a 1-d monatomic chain of length $L$, 
with nearest-neighbour spring constant K, atoms of mass $M$, and 
lattice constant $a$. 
Specifically, start from $\sum_q$ and by transforming this into 
an integral over $\omega$, obtain $Z(\omega)$.   Then 
draw a sketch of $Z(\omega)$ vs.\ $\omega$, labelling intercepts and 
asymptotes.
