\makeproblem{Resistor Mesh}{multiphysics:problemSet1:2}{ 
\makesubproblem{
Write a small matlab function that generates a netlist for a network made by:\(\cdots\)
%¿ a N×N square grid of resistors of value R, where N is the number of
%resistors per edge. The grid nodes are numbered from 1 to (N +1) 2 ;
%¿ a voltage source V = 1V connected between node 1 and ground;
%¿ three current sources, each one connected between a randomly-
%selected node of the grid and the reference node. The source current
%flows from the grid node to the reference node. Choose their value
%randomly between 10 mA and 100 mA;
%Generate the modified nodal analysis equations (1) for a grid with N =
%50, R = 0.2¿ and solve them with your LU routine to find the node
%voltages. Plot the result with the MATLAB command surf.

Plot the CPU time taken by your system solver (LU factorization + forward/backward substitution) as a function of the size \(n\) of the 3 modified nodal analysis matrix \(\BG\). Note: do not exploit the sparsity of the matrix.
\makesubproblem{
Determine experimentally how the CPU time scales for large \(n\).  Fit the CPU times you observe with a power law like \(t_{\mathrm{cpu}} (n) \simeq K n^\alpha \) where \(K\) is a constant in order to determine the exponent \(\alpha\).
