\section{Problem 1.}
\subsection{Part a.}

We've been given a harmonic oscillator

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:qmTwoExamReflection:10}
H = \frac{P^2}{2m} + \inv{2} k X^2
\end{equation}

where $k$ changes at time $t=0$ from it's initial value $k_0$, very suddenly to a final value of $0$ in time $T$ as illustrated in figure (\ref{fig:qmTwoExamReflection:qmTwoExamReflectionFig1})
\begin{figure}[htp]

   \caption{Flatting harmonic oscillator potential.}\label{fig:qmTwoExamReflection:qmTwoExamReflectionFig1}
\end{figure}

If the system is initially in it's ground state, how will it evolve after $t = T$?

This is a neat variation of the adiabatic problem, one that I intuitively knew what to do, but missed one detail.  Here's how I think I should have answered.

Our starting point is the ``formal'' solution of the Hamiltonian equation

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:qmTwoExamReflection:30}
\ket{\psi(t)} - \ket{\psi(t_0)} = \inv{i\hbar} \int_{t_0}^t H(t') \ket{\psi(t')} dt'
\end{equation}

As discussed in class, since we don't know $\ket{\psi(t)}$ it isn't obvious that this is of any value, but if the Hamiltonian changes very quickly the ket $\ket{\psi(t)}$ in the integral can be approximated with an average value (or the initial value).  Assuming the Hamiltonian completes its rapid change in time $T$, we end up with the conclusion that

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:qmTwoExamReflection:50}
\ket{\psi(T)} \approx \ket{\psi(t_0)}
\end{equation}

This approximation is only valid at the single point in time $T$ after the Hamiltonian change, after which the initial wave function must be described in terms of the basis kets for the new Hamiltonian.  An initial state is then a superposition of states in the new basis, and the evolution follows in the normal fashion.

Where this gets interesting in this case is that the final time Hamiltonian is that of a free particle, so we cannot express the initial state using a discrete basis of any sort

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:qmTwoExamReflection:70}
\psi(x, 0) = \sum_p c_p e^{i p x/\hbar},
\end{equation}

instead we end up with a wave packet that has a continuous split of resulting states, even if the initial wave function was that of a single state (like in this problem, where it was the ground state of the initial time harmonic oscillator).  We must write

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:qmTwoExamReflection:90}
\psi(x, 0) = \inv{\sqrt{2 \pi \hbar}} \int c(p, 0) e^{i p x/\hbar} dp.
\end{equation}

I confused myself in the exam by using a wave number representation

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:qmTwoExamReflection:110}
\psi(x, 0) = \inv{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \int c(k, 0) e^{i k x} dk,
\end{equation}

and then not cluing in how to describe the time evolution of this wave packet.  Had I worked in the momentum representation intuition may have told me that this evolution would take the form

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:qmTwoExamReflection:130}
\psi(x, t) = \inv{\sqrt{2 \pi \hbar}} \int c(p) e^{- i E_p t/\hbar} e^{i p x/\hbar} dp,
\end{equation}

where

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:qmTwoExamReflection:150}
E_p = \frac{p^2}{2m}.
\end{equation}

However intuition wasn't my friend at that point in time.  This isn't something that should have been hard to figure out, since the evolution, regardless of whether we have a discrete basis, or a continuous one, is a consequence of the Hamiltonian action.  Using the momentum parameterized representation of a wave packet, with the time evolution undetermined

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:qmTwoExamReflection:n}
\psi(x, t) = \inv{\sqrt{2 \pi \hbar}} \int c(p) U(p, t) e^{i p x/\hbar} dp,
\end{equation}

we find

\begin{align*}
0 &= 
\left(H - i \hbar \PD{t}{}\right) 
\psi(x, t) \\
&=
\left(H - i \hbar \PD{t}{}\right) 
\inv{\sqrt{2 \pi \hbar}} \int c(p) U(p, t) e^{i p x/\hbar} dp \\
&=
\inv{\sqrt{2 \pi \hbar}} \int c(p) \left( 
U(p, t) H e^{i p x/\hbar} 
-i \hbar \PD{t}{U(p, t)} e^{i p x/\hbar} 
\right) dp  \\
&=
\inv{\sqrt{2 \pi \hbar}} \int c(p) \left( 
U(p, t) \frac{p^2}{2m} 
-i \hbar \PD{t}{U(p, t)} 
\right) 
e^{i p x/\hbar} 
dp.
\end{align*}

Here we use the fact that the wave functions $e^{i p x/\hbar}$ are the momentum space energy eigenkets of the free particle Hamiltonian, with eigenvalues $p^2/2m$.

With this identically zero for all wave packets we must have

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:qmTwoExamReflection:n}
\PD{t}{U(p, t)} 
= 
\inv{i \hbar}
\frac{p^2}{2m} 
U(p, t).
\end{equation}

Integrating we have

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:qmTwoExamReflection:n}
U(p, t) = C \exp\left( -\frac{i p^2 t}{2m \hbar} \right),
\end{equation}

but since $U(p, 0) = 1$, the constant $C$ is just equal to unity.

Therefore the time evolution of the wave packet is given by

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:qmTwoExamReflection:n}
\psi(x, t) = \inv{\sqrt{2 \pi \hbar}} \int c(p) e^{-i p^2 t/(2m \hbar)} e^{i p x/\hbar} dp.
\end{equation}

Rather ironically, while relaxing after the exam, leisurely reading a book \cite{pauli2000wm} that I'd not touched since before starting PHY356 over a year ago, I find exactly this wave packet evolution described in \S 2.8, the spot just after I'd left off so long ago.  He did it by analogy with the discrete case, but the idea is the same ... both are consequences of the Hamiltonian operation on the wave function.

Understanding the general problem of wave packet evolution, given a Fourier description of that wave packet, we can now tackle the specific problem of the exam.

From the formula sheet we look up the ground state function and find

FIXME: 
- work through the rest of the problem.
	- compute the FT.
	- write out the rest.  Can it be expressed in any sort of closed form?
