\section{Problem 1.}
\subsection{Part a.}

We've been given a harmonic oscillator

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:qmTwoExamReflection:n}
H = \frac{P^2}{2m} + \inv{2} k X^2
\end{equation}

where $k$ changes at time $t=0$ from it's initial value $k_0$, very suddenly to a final value of $0$ in time $T$ as illustrated in figure (\ref{fig:qmTwoExamReflection:qmTwoExamReflectionFig1})

If the system is initially in it's ground state, how will it evolve after $t = T$?

This is a neat variation of the adiabatic problem, one that I intuitively knew what to do, but missed one detail.  Here's how I think I should have answered.

FIXME: 
- discuss sudden time approx.
- discuss continuum evolution.
- work through the problem.
- compute the FT.
- write the final solution.

From the formula sheet we look up the ground state function and find

...

Rather ironically, while relaxing after the exam in the tub with a book \cite{pauli2000wm}, not looking for anything particular and starting from where I'd left off reading before starting PHY356 over a year ago, I find exactly the wave packet evolution described in \S 2.8.  He did it by analogy with the discrete case, but the idea is the same ... both are consequences of the Hamiltonian operation on the wave function.
