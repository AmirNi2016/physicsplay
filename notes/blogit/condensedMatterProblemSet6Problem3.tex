\makeoproblem{Bulk modulus}{condensedMatter:problemSet6:3}{\citep{ibach2009solid} pr 6.3}{
The bulk modulus $\kappa$ is given by the second derivative of the total energy $E_{\mathrm{tot}}$ with respect to the volume

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:condensedMatterProblemSet6Problem3:10}
\kappa = \inv{V} \PDSq{V}{E_{\mathrm{tot}}}.
\end{dmath}

Estimate the bulk moduli of alkali metals by assuming that the total energy is equivalent to the kinetic energy of the Fermi gas.  What has been neglected in this estimate?
