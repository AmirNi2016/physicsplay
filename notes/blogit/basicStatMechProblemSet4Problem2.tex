An ideal gas starts at $(V_0, P_0)$ in the pressure-volume diagram (x-axis = $V$, y-axis = $P$), then moves at constant pressure to a larger volume $(V_1, P_0)$, then moves to a larger pressure at constant volume to $(V_1, P_1)$, and finally returns to $(V_0, P_0)$, thus undergoing a cyclic process (forming a triangle in $P-V$ plane). For each step, find the work done on the gas, the change in energy content, and heat added to the gas. Find the total work/energy/heat change over the entire cycle.
