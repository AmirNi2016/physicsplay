Consider an electron confined to the interior of a finite hollow cylinder with its axis being \( \zcap \). Let the inner and outer
walls of the cylinder be at radial coordinates \( \rho_a \) and \( \rho_b > \rho_a \) respectively.  Let the cylinder have its top and bottom
ends at \( z = 0,L \).
(i) Find the eigenstates for a particle confined to this cylinder (ignore normalization), and show that its energies are
given by

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:gradQuantumProblemSet3Problem3:n}
E_{l m n} = \frac{\Hbar}{2 m } \lr{ k_{m n}^2 + \lr{ \frac{ \pi l }{m} }^2 } \qquad ( l = 1,2,3, \cdots ; m = 0, 1, 2, \cdots )
\end{dmath}

where \( k_{m n} \) is the $n$th root of the equation

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:gradQuantumProblemSet3Problem3:n}
J_m (k_{m n} \rho_b ) N_m (k_{m n} \rho a ) - N_m (k_{m n} \rho_b ) J_m (k_{m n} \rho_a ) = 0.
\end{dmath}

(ii) Repeat this problem with a uniform magnetic field \( B \zcap \) which is confined to the region \( 0 < \rho < \rho_a \) (i.e., only in
the hollow part of the cylinder). Show that there is a periodicity of the energy levels with the field, with the period
being such that
