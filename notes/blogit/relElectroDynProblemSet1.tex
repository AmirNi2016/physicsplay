\section{Problem 2.}
\subsection{Statement}

From the Lorentz transformations of space and time coordinates.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Derive the transformation of velocities.  With a particle moving with $\Bv$ in the unprimed (stationary) frame, find its velocity $\Bv'$ in the primed frame.  The primed frame is moving with some $\BV$ with respect to the unprimed one.  Make sure to finally derive the general ``addition of velocities'' equation in terms of vectors and dot products, as given in \cite{landau1971classical}.
\item Then, use the addition of velocities rule to show that: a) if $v < c$ in one frame, then $v' < c$ in any other frame.  b.) If $v = c$ in one frame, then $v' = c$ in any other frame, and c.) if $v> c$ in one frame, than $v' > c$ in any other frame.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Solution}
\subsubsection{Part 1.}

We need a vector form of the Lorentz transform to start with.  Let's write $\Bsigma$ for a unit vector colinear with the primed frame velocity $\BV$, so that $\BV = (\BV \cdot \Bsigma) \Bsigma$.  When our boost was in the $x$ direction, our Lorentz transformation was in terms of $x = \Bx \cdot \xcap$.  The component in the direction of the boost is now $\Bx \cdot \Bsigma$, and we have

\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}\label{eqn:relativisticElectrodynamicsA1:200}
c t' &= \gamma \left( ct - (\Bx \cdot \Bsigma) \frac{\BV \cdot \Bsigma}{c} \right) \\
\Bx' \cdot \Bsigma &= \gamma \left( \Bx \cdot \Bsigma - \frac{\BV \cdot \Bsigma}{c} c t \right) \\
\Bx' \wedge \Bsigma &= \Bx \wedge \Bsigma .
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

We can add the vector components using $\Bx = (\Bx \cdot \Bsigma) \Bsigma + (\Bx \wedge \Bsigma) \Bsigma$, leaving

\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}\label{eqn:relativisticElectrodynamicsA1:210}
c t' &= \gamma \left( ct - (\Bx \cdot \Bsigma) \frac{\BV \cdot \Bsigma}{c} \right) \\
\Bx' &= (\Bx \wedge \Bsigma) \Bsigma + \gamma \left( (\Bx \cdot \Bsigma) \Bsigma - \frac{\BV}{c} c t \right) .
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

Writing $(\Bx \wedge \Bsigma) \Bsigma = \Bx - (\Bx \cdot \Bsigma)\Bsigma$ we have for the spatial component transformation

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:relativisticElectrodynamicsA1:220}
\Bx' = \Bx + (\Bx \cdot \Bsigma) \Bsigma (\gamma - 1) - \gamma \frac{\BV}{c} c t.
\end{equation}

Now we are set to take derivatives to calculate the velocities.  This gives us
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}\label{eqn:relativisticElectrodynamicsA1:230}
\frac{dt'}{dt} &= \gamma \left( 1 - \left( \frac{d\Bx}{dt} \cdot \Bsigma \right) \frac{\BV \cdot \Bsigma}{c^2} \right) \\
\frac{d\Bx'}{dt'} \frac{d t'}{dt} &= \frac{d\Bx}{dt} + \left(\frac{d\Bx}{dt} \cdot \Bsigma\right) \Bsigma (\gamma - 1) - \gamma \frac{\BV}{c} c .
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

Dividing this pair of equations, and using $\Bv = d\Bx/dt$, and $\Bv' = d\Bx'/dt'$, this is

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:relativisticElectrodynamicsA1:240}
\Bv' = \frac{\gamma^{-1} \Bv + (\Bv \cdot \Bsigma) \Bsigma (1 - \gamma^{-1}) - \BV}{ 1 - \left( \Bv \cdot \Bsigma \right) (\BV \cdot \Bsigma)/c^2 }.
\end{equation}

Since $\BV$ and our direction vector $\Bsigma$ are colinear, we have $(\Bv \cdot \Bsigma) (\BV \cdot \Bsigma) = \Bv \cdot \Bsigma$, and can simplify this last expression slightly

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:relativisticElectrodynamicsA1:250}
\Bv' = \frac{\gamma^{-1} \Bv + (\Bv \cdot \Bsigma) \Bsigma (1 - \gamma^{-1}) - \BV}{ 1 - \Bv \cdot \BV/c^2 }.
\end{equation}

Finally, if we are to compare to the text, we note that the inverse expression requires replacement of $\BV$ with $-\BV$ and switching $\Bv$ with $\Bv'$.  That gives us

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:relativisticElectrodynamicsA1:250i}
\Bv = \frac{\gamma^{-1} \Bv' + (\Bv' \cdot \Bsigma) \Bsigma (1 - \gamma^{-1}) + \BV}{ 1 + \Bv' \cdot \BV/c^2 }.
\end{equation}

The expression in the text is also a small velocity approximation.  For $\Abs{\BV} \ll c$, we have $\gamma^{-1} \approx 1$, and $(1 + \Bv' \cdot \BV/c^2)^{-1} \approx 1 - \Bv' \cdot \BV/c^2$.  This gives us

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:relativisticElectrodynamicsA1:250a}
\Bv \approx (\Bv' + \BV)( 1 - \Bv' \cdot \BV/c^2 ) \approx \BV + \Bv' - \Bv' (\Bv' \cdot \BV)/c^2
\end{equation}

One additional approximation was made dropping the $\BV (\Bv' \cdot \BV)/c^2$ term which is quadratic in $\BV/c$, which leave us with equation $5.3$ in the text as desired.

\subsubsection{Part 2.}

In \ref{eqn:relativisticElectrodynamicsA1:250i}, let's write $\Bv' = u \Bu$, where $\Bu$ is a unit vector, $V = \BV \cdot \Bsigma$, and $\alpha = \Bu \cdot \Bsigma$ for the direction cosine between the primed frame's direction of motion and the particle's velocity direction (also in the unprimed frame).  The stationary frame's particle velocity is then

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:relativisticElectrodynamicsA1:260}
\Bv = \frac{\gamma^{-1} u \Bu + u \alpha \Bsigma (1 - \gamma^{-1}) + V \Bsigma}{ 1 + \alpha u V/c^2 }.
\end{equation}

As a check, note that for $1 = \alpha = \Bu \cdot \Bsigma = \cos(0)$, we recover the familiar addition of velocities formula 

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:relativisticElectrodynamicsA1:260b}
\Bv = \Bu \frac{u + V}{ 1 + u V/c^2 }.
\end{equation}

We want to put \ref{eqn:relativisticElectrodynamicsA1:260} into a form that renders it more tractable for general angles too.  Factoring out the $\gamma^{-1}$ term appears to do the job, yielding

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:relativisticElectrodynamicsA1:260c}
\Bv = \frac{u \gamma^{-1} (\Bu -\alpha \Bsigma) + (u \alpha + V) \Bsigma}{ 1 + \alpha u V/c^2 }.
\end{equation}

After a bit of reduction and rearranging we can dot this with itself to calculate

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:relativisticElectrodynamicsA1:270}
\Bv^2 = \frac{V^2(1 - \alpha^2)(1 - u^2/c^2) + (u + \alpha V)^2}{ (1 + \alpha u V/c^2)^2 }
\end{equation}

Note that for $u = c$, we have $\Bv^2 = c^2$, regardless of the direction of $\BV$ with respect to the motion of the particle in the unprimed frame.  This shouldn't be surprising since this light like invariance is exactly what the Lorentz transformation is designed to maintain.  It is however slightly comforting to know that the algebra appears to be still be kosher after all this.  This also answers part (b) of this question, since we have tackled the $v = c$ case in the primed frame, and seen that the speed remains $v = c$ in the unprimed frame (and thus any frame moving at constant speed relative to another).

Observe that since $1 - \alpha^2 = \sin^2\theta$, and $u \le c$, this is positive definite as expected.  If one allowed $u > c$ in some frame, our speed could go imaginary!

For the $u < c$ and $u > c$ cases, let $x = u/c$ and $y = V/c$.  This allows \ref{eqn:relativisticElectrodynamicsA1:270} to be casted in a simpler form

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:relativisticElectrodynamicsA1:270e}
\Bv^2 = c^2 \frac{y^2 (1 - \alpha^2)(1 - x^2) + (x + \alpha y)^2}{ (1 + \alpha x y)^2 }
\end{equation}

We wish to verify that (a) given any $x \in (-1,1)$, we have $\Bv^2 < c^2$ for all $y \in (-1,1)$, $\alpha \in (-1,1)$, and (c) given any $\Abs{x} > 1$, we have $\Bv^2 > c^2$ for all $y \in (-1,1)$, $\alpha \in (-1,1)$.

Considering (a) first, this requires a demonstration that 

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:relativisticElectrodynamicsA1:280}
y^2 (1 - \alpha^2)(1 - x^2) + (x + \alpha y)^2 < (1 + \alpha x y)^2 .
\end{equation}

Expanding out the products and cancelling terms, we want to show that for (a) that if $\Abs{x},\Abs{y} < 1$ we have

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:relativisticElectrodynamicsA1:290a}
x^2 (1 - y^2) + y^2 < 1,
\end{equation}

and for (c) that if $\Abs{x} > 1$, we have for any $\Abs{y} < 1$

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:relativisticElectrodynamicsA1:290c}
x^2 (1 - y^2) + y^2 > 1.
\end{equation}

Observe that the frame velocity orientation direction cosines have completely dropped out, leaving just the (relative to $c$) velocity terms.

To get an initial feel for this function $f(x,y) = x^2 (1 - y^2) + y^2$, notice that \href{http://goo.gl/5AnNF}{when graphed} we have a bowl with a minimum (zero) at the origin, and what appears to be a uniform value of one on the boundary (case (b)).  Then provided $\Abs{y} < 1$ it appears that the function $f$ increases monotonically to a value greater than one (case (c)).  While looking at a plot is not any sort of rigorous proof, let's move on to some of the other problems for now, and return to this last loose thread later if time permits.

\section{Problem 3.}
\subsection{Statement}

A toy model of a GPS system has satellites moving in a straight line with constant velocity $V_x$ and at a constant height $h$ (measured, e.g., along the y-axis) above ``ground'' (the x-axis).  The satellites broadcast the time in their rest frame as well as their location at a time of broadcast.  Imagine a person on the ground recieves simultaneously broadcasts from two satellites, $A$ and $B$, reporting their locations $x_A'$ and $x_B'$ as well as times of broadcast (which happen to be equal), $t_A' = t_B'$.	

\begin{enumerate}
\item  Find a condition determining your position in $x$.  Evaluate it to find your deviation from the midpoint between the satellites to first order in $V_x/c$.
\item For some real numbers, note that in reality there are 24 satellites, moving with $V ~4 \text{km}/s$, a distance $R \approx 2.7 \times 10^4 \text{km}$.  Use these numbers and the result from the previous problem (assuming a flat Earth, to be sure...) to get an idea whether (special) relativisitic effects are important for the typical modern GPS accuracy of order 10 m (or less)?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Discussion of the non-toy model.}

It is fairly easy to find interesting info about the mechanisms that real GPS works using.  NASA has a nice \href{http://www.nasm.si.edu/gps/work.html}{How does GPS work} page \cite{nasaGPS}, and How stuff works has a nice \href{http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/gadgets/travel/gps.htm}{How GPS Receivers Work} article \cite{howStuffWorksGPS}.  Reading these one finds that the GPS clocks are actually kept synchronized.  The typical GPS reciever obviously has a clock, since we have countdown timers for time until arrival, is that clock accurate enough compared to the satellite atomic clocks to be used for the GPS location algorithm?  What is done in fact is to use the local reciever time to seed the iterative algorithms, allowing the local time to be calculated eventually with an accuracy that actually approaches that of the satellite's atomic clocks.  Some of the sources of error, like reflection of the signals, delaying them, and interference by atmosphere are also discussed in these articles.  Also interesting is that there is a table lookup of the satellites position implemented in the GPS recievers.  This table lookup is used to seed the iterative algorithms, and can be used to reduce calculation error.

Our basic GPS problem is to calcuate the intersection of a number of ``spherical'' hypersurfaces.  This is made more interesting by the fact that this is both a non-linear and an over-specified problem.  Let's consider the geometric problem to get an idea of how to set up this problem.  Suppose that we have a set of $k$ satellites, located at position $\Bp_i, i \in [1,k]$, and we know that these are located with distance $d_i$ from our position $\Bx$.

Our problem is then to find the simultaneous solution to the following set of equations

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:relativisticElectrodynamicsA1:300}
\begin{aligned}
(\Bx - \Bp_1)^2 &= d_1^2 \\
(\Bx - \Bp_2)^2 &= d_2^2 \\
\vdots \\
(\Bx - \Bk_2)^2 &= d_k^2.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Observe that even if we reduce this to a one dimensional problem in a single variable $x$, we still have a non-linear system

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:relativisticElectrodynamicsA1:300b}
\begin{aligned}
0 &= (x - p_1)^2 - d_1^2 \\
0 &= (x - p_2)^2 - d_2^2 \\
\vdots \\
0 &= (x - k_2)^2 - d_k^2.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

We also need to be aware of the fact that each of the positions $p_i$, and the respective distances $d_i$ will in reality both have associated errors, so there is not likely any specific single value of $x$ that ``solves'' this problem, unless it is setup in a contrived and perfect fashion.  This intrinsic error, and the $k$ equations, one unknown nature of the problem (or three unknowns for spatial, or four for spatial and time position) suggests a least squares approach, but it will have to be one that also incorporates iteration.
