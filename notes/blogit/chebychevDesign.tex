%\label{chap:chebychevDesign}

In our text \citep{balanis2005antenna} is a design procedure that applies Chebychev polynomials to the selection of current magnitudes for an evenly spaced array of identical antennas placed along the z-axis.

For an even number \( 2 M \) of identical antennas placed at positions \( \Br_m = (d/2) \lr{2 m -1} \Be_3 \), the array factor is

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:chebychevDesign:20}
\textrm{AF} 
= 
\sum_{m=-N}^N I_m e^{-j k \rcap \cdot \Br_m }.
\end{dmath}

Assuming the currents are symmetric \( I_{-m} = I_m \), with \( \rcap = (\sin\theta \cos\phi, \sin\theta \sin\phi, \cos\theta ) \), and \( u = \frac{\pi d}{\lambda} \cos\theta \), this is

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:chebychevDesign:40}
\textrm{AF}
= 
\sum_{m=-N}^N I_m e^{-j k (d/2) (  2 m -1 )\cos\theta }
= 
2 \sum_{m=1}^N I_m \cos\lr{ k (d/2) ( 2 m -1)\cos\theta } % 
=
2 \sum_{m=1}^N I_m \cos\lr{ (2 m -1) u }.
\end{dmath}

This is a sum of only odd cosines, and can be expanded as a sum that includes all the odd powers of \( \cos u \).
%  The odd degree Chebychev polynomials \( T_m(\cos\theta) = \cos(m \theta) \) are similar, since the expansion of that in \( \cos\theta \) has all the that can be expanded
