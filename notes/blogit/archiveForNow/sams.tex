\section{Motivation.}

It seems very complex to do this with anything but complex numbers.  Suppose the angle of separation between the points is $\theta$.  Our points are then at $1. e^{i\theta}, e^{2i\theta}, ..., e^{n i \theta}$.  Then the desired product is

\begin{align*}
\Pi_{k=1}^n \Abs{ e^{k i \theta} - e^{(k-1)i\theta} } 
&=
\Pi_{k=1}^n \underbrace{\Abs{ e^{(k-1)/2}i \theta} }_{=1} \Abs{ \underbrace{e^{i \theta/2} - e^{-i\theta/2}}_{= 2i \sin\theta/2} } \\
&= (2 \sin\theta/2)^n
\end{align*}

For equally spaced distributed evenly around the entire unit circle we have $\theta = 2 \pi/n$, for a final result of

\begin{align*}
(2 \sin \pi/n)^n
\end{align*}
