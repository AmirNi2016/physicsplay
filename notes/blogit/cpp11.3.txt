Here's 

<h2>throw() as noexcept equivalent</h2>

throw() without any exception types can be used as an equivalent to the new noexcept keyword.  Stroustrup also mentions that explicit throw() clauses 

[sourcecode language="cpp"]
void foo() throw( e1, e2 ) ;
[/sourcecode]

haven't worked out well in practise, and is deprecated.

<h2>try scopes as function body</h2>

It turns out that try clauses can be used as function bodies, as in

[sourcecode language="cpp"]
void foo( void )
try {
}
catch ( ... )
{
}
[/sourcecode]

This can also be done for constructor and destructor bodies as in

[sourcecode language="cpp"]
X::X( T1 v, T2 w )
try{
 : f1( v )
 , f2( w )
}
catch ( ... )
{
}
[/sourcecode]

so that a throw in the class field member construction can also be caught.
