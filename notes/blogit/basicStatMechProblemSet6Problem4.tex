\makeoproblem{Neutron star}{basicStatMech:problemSet6:4}{K. Huang, prob 16.5}{
%(3 points)
Model a neutron star as an ideal Fermi gas of neutrons at $T = 0$ moving in the gravitational field of a heavy point mass $M$ at the center. Show that the pressure $P$ obeys the equation

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:basicStatMechProblemSet6Problem4:20}
\frac{dP}{dr} = - \gamma M \frac{\rho(r)}{r^2},
\end{dmath}

where $\gamma$ is the gravitational constant, $r$ is the distance from the center, and $\rho(r)$ is the density which only depends on distance from the center.
