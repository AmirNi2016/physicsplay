%(3 points)
Model a neutron star as an ideal Fermi gas of neutrons at T = 0 moving in the gravitational field of a heavy point mass
M at the center. Show that the pressure P obeys the equation dP/dr = -?M?(r)/r2where ? is the gravitational
constant, r is the distance from the center, and ?(r) is the density which only depends on distance from the center.
