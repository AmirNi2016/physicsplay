\makeproblem{Transmission power determination.}{advancedantenna:problemSet1:5}{ 
A repeater link consists of a transmitter and a receiver at 10 \si{GHz} in a line-of-sight
arrangement of distance 10\si{km}. The transmitting and receiving antennas are identical
horns with gain over isotropic equal to 15 \si{dB}. For acceptable signal-to-noise ratio, the
power received must be greater than 10 \si{nW}. Loss due to polarization mismatch is not
expected to exceed 3 \si{dB}. Determine the minimum transmitted power that should be used.
