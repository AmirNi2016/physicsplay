\generatetitle{Plane wave solutions of Maxwell's equation using Geometric Algebra}
\label{chap:\basename}
\section{Motivation}

Study of reflection and transmission of radition in isotropic, charge and current free, linear matter utilizes the plane wave solutions to Maxwell's equations.  These have the structure of phasor equations, with some specific constraints on the components and the exponents. 

These constraints are usually derived starting with the plain old vector form of Maxwell's equations, and it is natural to wonder how this is done directly using Geometric Algebra.  \citep{doran2003gap} provides one such derivation, using the covariant form of Maxwell's equations.  Here's a slightly more pedestrian way of doing the same.

\section{Guts}

We start with Maxwell's equations for linear matter as found in \citep{griffith1981introduction}
