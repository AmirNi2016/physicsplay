\section{Motivation.}

We now know how to formulate the energy momentum tensor for complex vector fields (ie. phasors) in the Geometric Algebra formalism.  To recap, for the field $F = \BE + I c \BB$, where $\BE$ and $\BB$ may be complex vectors we have for Maxwell's equation

\begin{align}\label{eqn:fourierMaxVac:1}
\grad F = J/\epsilon_0 c.
\end{align}

This is a doubly complex representation, with the four vector pseudoscalar $I = \gamma_0 \gamma_1 \gamma_2 \gamma_3$ acting as a non-commutatitive imaginary, as well as real and imaginary parts for the electric and magnetic field vectors.  We take the real part (not the scalar part) of any bivector solution $F$ of Maxwell's equation as the actual solution, but allow ourself the freedom to work with the complex phasor representation when convienient.  In these phasor vectors, the imaginary $i$, as in $\BE = \Real(\BE) + i \Imag(\BE)$, is a commuting imaginary, commuting with all the multivector elements in the algebra.

The real valued, four vector, energy momentum tensor $T(a)$ was found to be

\begin{align}\label{eqn:fourierMaxVac:2}
T(a) = \frac{\epsilon_0}{4} \Bigl( \conjugateStar{F} a \tilde{F} + \tilde{F} a \conjugateStar{F} \Bigr) = 
-\frac{\epsilon_0}{2} \Real \Bigl( \conjugateStar{F} a F \Bigr)  
\end{align}

To supply some context that gives meaning to this tensor the associated conservation relationship was found to be

\begin{align}\label{eqn:fourierMaxVac:3}
\grad \cdot T(a) &= a \cdot \inv{ c } \Real \left( J \cdot \conjugateStar{F} \right).
\end{align}

and in particular for $a = \gamma^0$, this four vector divergence takes the form

\begin{align}\label{eqn:fourierMaxVac:4}
\PD{t}{}\frac{\epsilon_0}{2}(\BE \cdot \conjugateStar{\BE} + c^2 \BB \cdot \conjugateStar{\BB})
+ \spacegrad \cdot \inv{\mu_0} \Real (\BE \cross \conjugateStar{\BB} )
+ \Real( \BJ \cdot \conjugateStar{\BE} ) 
= 0,
\end{align}

relating the energy term $T^{00} = T(\gamma^0) \cdot \gamma^0$ and the Poynting spatial vector $T(\gamma^0) \wedge \gamma^0$ with the current density and electric field product that consititutes the energy portion of the Lorentz force density.

Let's apply this to calculating the energy associated with the field that is periodic within a rectangular prism as done by Bohm in \cite{bohm1989qt}.  We do not neccessarily need the Geometric Algebra formalism for this calculation, but this will be a fun way to attempt it.
