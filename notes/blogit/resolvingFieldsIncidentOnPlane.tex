In order to apply the Fresnel equations, the field components have to be resolved into components where either the electric field or the magnetic field is parallel to the plane of reflection.  The geometry of this, with the wave vector direction \( \kcap \) and the electric and magnetic field phasors perpendicular to that direction is sketched in \cref{fig:resolvingFieldsIncidentOnObliquePlane:resolvingFieldsIncidentOnObliquePlaneFig1}.
