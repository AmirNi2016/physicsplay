Consider a set of $N$ independent classical harmonic oscillators, each having a frequency $\omega$. Find the canonical partition at a temperature $T$ for this system of oscillators keeping track of correction factors of Planck constant. (Note that the oscillators are distinguishable, and we do not need $1/N!$ correction factor.)  Using this, derive the mean energy and the specific heat at temperature $T$. For quantum oscillators, the partition function of each oscillator is simply $\sum_n e^{-\beta E_n}$ where $E_n$ are the (discrete) energy levels given by $(n + 1/2)\hbar \omega$, with $n = 0,1,2,\cdots$.  Hence, find the canonical partition function for $N$ independent distinguishable quantum oscillators, and find the mean energy and specific heat at temperature $T$. Show that the quantum results go over into the classical results at high temperature $k_{\mathrm{B}} T \gg \hbar \omega$, and comment on why this makes sense.  Also find the low temperature behavior of the specific heat in both classical and quantum cases when $k_{\mathrm{B}} T \ll \hbar \omega$.
