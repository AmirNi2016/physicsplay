\section{Motivation.}

In an informal discussion after class, it was claimed that the steady state flow down a plane would have constant height, unless you bring surface tension effects into the mix.  Part of that statement just doesn't make sense to me.  Consider the forces acting on the fluid in the figure (\ref{fig:inclinedFlowWithoutConstantHeightAssumption:inclinedFlowWithoutConstantHeightAssumptionFig3})

\begin{figure}[htp]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[totalheight=0.2\textheight]{inclinedFlowWithoutConstantHeightAssumptionFig3}
   \caption{Gravitational force components acting on fluid flowing down a plane.}\label{fig:inclinedFlowWithoutConstantHeightAssumption:inclinedFlowWithoutConstantHeightAssumptionFig3}
\end{figure}

In the inclined reference frame we have a component of the force acting downwards (in the negative y-axis direction), and have a component directed down the x-axis.  Wouldn't this act to both push the fluid down the plane and push part of the fluid downwards?  I'd expect this to introduce some vorticity as depicted.

While we are just about to start covered surface tension, perhaps this is just allowing the surface to vary, and then solving the Navier-Stokes equations that result.  Let's try setting up the Navier-Stokes equation for steady state viscous flow down a plane without any assumption that the height is constant and see how far we can get.

\section{The equations of motion.}

We'll use the same coordinates as before, with the directions given as in figure (\ref{fig:inclinedFlowWithoutConstantHeightAssumption:inclinedFlowWithoutConstantHeightAssumptionFig1}).  However, this time, we let the height $h(x)$ of the fluid at any distance $x$ down the plane from the initial point vary.

\begin{figure}[htp]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[totalheight=0.2\textheight]{inclinedFlowWithoutConstantHeightAssumptionFig1}
   \caption{inclinedFlowWithoutConstantHeightAssumptionFig1}\label{fig:inclinedFlowWithoutConstantHeightAssumption:inclinedFlowWithoutConstantHeightAssumptionFig1}
\end{figure}

For viscous incompressible flow down the plane our equations of motion are

\begin{align}\label{eqn:inclinedFlowWithoutConstantHeightAssumption:20}
\rho \PD{t}{u} + \rho (u \partial_x + v \partial_y) u &= -\partial_x p + \mu \left(\partial_{xx} + \partial_{yy}\right) u + \rho g \sin\alpha \\
\rho \PD{t}{v} + \rho (u \partial_x + v \partial_y) v &= -\partial_y p + \mu \left(\partial_{xx} + \partial_{yy}\right) v - \rho g \cos\alpha \\
0 &= -\partial_z p \\
0 &= \partial_x u + \partial_y v
\end{align}

Now, can we kill the time dependent term?  Even allowing for $u$ to vary with $x$ and introducing a non-horizontal flow component, I think that we can.  If the flow at $x = 0$ is constant, not varying at all with time, I think it makes sense that we will have no time dependence in the flow for $x \ne 0$.  So, I believe that our starting point is as above, but with the time derivatives killed off.  That is

\begin{align}\label{eqn:inclinedFlowWithoutConstantHeightAssumption:40}
\rho (u \partial_x + v \partial_y) u &= -\partial_x p + \mu \left(\partial_{xx} + \partial_{yy}\right) u + \rho g \sin\alpha \\
\rho (u \partial_x + v \partial_y) v &= -\partial_y p + \mu \left(\partial_{xx} + \partial_{yy}\right) v - \rho g \cos\alpha \\
0 &= -\partial_z p \\
0 &= \partial_x u + \partial_y v.
\end{align}

These don't look particularily easy to solve, and we haven't even set up the boundary value constraints yet.  Let's do that next.

\section{The boundary value constraints.}

We'll have a boundary constraint on the pressure at the interface

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:inclinedFlowWithoutConstantHeightAssumption:60}
p(h(x)) = p_A
\end{equation}

and the no-slip condition for the velocity components at the base of the slope

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:inclinedFlowWithoutConstantHeightAssumption:80}
u(x, 0) = v(x, 0) = 0
\end{equation}

We should also have a zero tangential component to the traction vector at the interface.  We need to consider some geometry, and refer to figure (\ref{fig:inclinedFlowWithoutConstantHeightAssumption:inclinedFlowWithoutConstantHeightAssumptionFig2})

\begin{figure}[htp]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[totalheight=0.2\textheight]{inclinedFlowWithoutConstantHeightAssumptionFig2}
   \caption{inclinedFlowWithoutConstantHeightAssumptionFig2}\label{fig:inclinedFlowWithoutConstantHeightAssumption:inclinedFlowWithoutConstantHeightAssumptionFig2}
\end{figure}

A position vector on the surface has the value

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:inclinedFlowWithoutConstantHeightAssumption:100}
\Br = x \xcap + h \ycap
\end{equation}

so that a differential element on the surface, tangential to the surface is proportional to

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:inclinedFlowWithoutConstantHeightAssumption:120}
d\Br = \left( \xcap + \ddx{h} \ycap \right) dx
\end{equation}

so our unit tangent vector in the direction depicted in the figure is

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:inclinedFlowWithoutConstantHeightAssumption:140}
\taucap = \inv{\sqrt{1 + (h')^2}} \left( 1, h' \right).
\end{equation}

The outwards facing normal has a value, up to a factor of plus or minus one, of

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:inclinedFlowWithoutConstantHeightAssumption:160}
\ncap = 
\inv{\sqrt{1 + (h')^2}} \left( h', -1 \right).
\end{equation}

We can fix the orientation by considering the unit bivector

\begin{align*}
\taucap \wedge \ncap &= 
\inv{1 + (h')^2} 
\left( 1, h' \right) 
\wedge
\left( h', -1 \right) \\
&=
\begin{vmatrix}
1 & h' \\
h' & -1
\end{vmatrix}
\Be_1 \Be_2 \\
&=
( -1 - (h')^2 )
\Be_1 \Be_2.
\end{align*}

So we really want the other orientation

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:inclinedFlowWithoutConstantHeightAssumption:180}
\ncap = \inv{\sqrt{1 + (h')^2}} \left( -h', 1 \right).
\end{equation}

Our traction vector relative to the normal $\ncap$ is

\begin{align*}
\Bt 
&= \Be_i T_{ij} n_j \\
&= 
\Be_i \left( -p \delta_{ij}
+ \mu e_{ij}
\right) n_j \\
&=
-p \ncap + \mu \Be_i e_{ij} n_j
\end{align*}

So the component in the tangential direction is

\begin{align*}
\Bt \cdot \taucap 
&=
-p \cancel{\ncap \cdot \taucap} + \mu \Be_i e_{ij} n_j tau_i \\
&=
\frac{\mu}{1 + (h')^2}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & h' 
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
e_{11} & e_{12} \\
e_{21} & e_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
-h'  \\
1
\end{bmatrix} \\
&=
\frac{\mu}{1 + (h')^2}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & h' 
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
-h' e_{11} + e_{12} \\
-h' e_{21} + e_{22}
\end{bmatrix} \\
&=
\frac{\mu}{1 + (h')^2}
\left(
-h' e_{11} + e_{12} + h'( -h' e_{21} + e_{22} )
\right) \\
&=
\frac{\mu}{1 + (h')^2}
\left(
h' (e_{22} - e_{11} )
+ e_{12} (1 - (h')^2 )
\right) 
\end{align*}

Our strain tensor components, for a general 2D flow, are

\begin{align}\label{eqn:inclinedFlowWithoutConstantHeightAssumption:200}
e_{11} &= \PD{x}{u} \\
e_{22} &= \PD{y}{v} \\
e_{12} &= 
\inv{2} \left( 
\PD{x}{v} +
\PD{y}{u}
\right).
\end{align}

So, a zero tangential traction vector component at the interface requires

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:inclinedFlowWithoutConstantHeightAssumption:220}
0 = h' \left( \PD{y}{v} - \PD{x}{u} \right) + 
\inv{2} \left( 
\PD{x}{v} +
\PD{y}{u}
\right)
(1 - (h')^2 ).
\end{equation}

What is the normal component of the traction vector at the interface?  We can calculate

\begin{align*}
\Bt \cdot \taucap 
&=
-p + \mu \Be_i e_{ij} n_j n_i \\
&=
\frac{\mu}{1 + (h')^2}
\begin{bmatrix}
-h' & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
-h' e_{11} + e_{12} \\
-h' e_{21} + e_{22}
\end{bmatrix} \\
&=
\frac{\mu}{1 + (h')^2}
\left(
-h'(-h' e_{11} + e_{12}) -h' e_{21} + e_{22}
\right)  \\
&=
\frac{\mu}{1 + (h')^2}
\left(
-2 h' e_{12} 
+ (h')^2 e_{11} + e_{22}
\right)
\end{align*}

So this component of the traction vector is
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:inclinedFlowWithoutConstantHeightAssumption:240}
\Bt \cdot \taucap 
=
\frac{\mu}{1 + (h')^2}
\left(
- h' 
\left( 
\PD{x}{v} +
\PD{y}{u}
\right)
+ (h')^2 \PD{x}{u} 
 + \PD{y}{v} 
\right)
\end{equation}

For the purely recilinear flow, with $h' = 0$ and $v = 0$ this was zero overall, but that was a consequence of NS and our assumptions.  How about in this more general case?  Is this one of our boundary value conditions, or will we end up with something non-zero, and that non-zero value characterizes the fact that we have some downwards flow in the fluid?
