\makeproblem{Testing antenna gain.}{advancedantenna:problemSet2:2}{ 

One way to measure the absolute gain of an antenna under test (AUT) is to use a ``standard-gain'' antenna (usually a horn) which has a known gain \( G_{\textrm{sg}}\).
Consider a two antenna setup, where port \#1 is connected to a transmitting antenna \( G_\txtx \). 
First, the second antenna connected to port \#2 is the standard-gain one. Then at port \#2 we connect the unknown antenna under test \( G_{\textrm{AUT}} \).

Show that,

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:advancedantennaProblemSet2Problem2:20}
\frac{P_2^{\textrm{AUT}}}{P_2^{\textrm{sg}}}
=
\frac{G_{\textrm{sg}}}{G_{\textrm{AUT}}},
\end{dmath}

where the left-hand side of the above equation represents the ratio of the powers received by the antenna under test and the standard-gain antenna.
