I was attempting \citep{pathriastatistical} problem 2.5 on the commute today, and meant to ask you about it after class, but missed you.

The problem asks to show that 

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:pathriaCh2P5:20}
\oint p dq = \lr{ n + \inv{2} } h,
\end{equation}

provided the particle's potential is such that 

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:pathriaCh2P5:40}
m \hbar \Abs{ \frac{dV}{dq} } \ll \lr{ m ( E - V ) }^{3/2}.
\end{equation}

I was able to show that \eqref{eqn:pathriaCh2P5:40} is equivalent to the WKB condition

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:pathriaCh2P5:80}
\frac{k'}{k^2} \ll 1,
\end{equation}

for a solution of the form

\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:pathriaCh2P5:60}
k^2(q) = 2 m (E - V(q))/\hbar^2
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:pathriaCh2P5:100}
\psi(q) = \inv{\sqrt{k}} e^{\pm i \int k(q) dq}.
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}

However, I'm not sure what to make of the condition on the allowed values of the momentum \eqref{eqn:pathriaCh2P5:20}.  In a classical context, this $\int p dq$ is the area contained by the phase space trajectory.  However, for this quantum problem $p$ and $q$ are operators.  What does this integral even mean?

Can you point me in the right direction.
