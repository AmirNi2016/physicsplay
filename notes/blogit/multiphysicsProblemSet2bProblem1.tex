\makeproblem{Newton's method}{multiphysics:problemSet2b:1}{ 

Consider the circuit in \cref{fig:ps2b:ps2bFig1}.  By setting \( R = 1, I{{s1} = 5, I_{s2} = 10^{-6}\), and using diode parameters \( I_0 = 10^{-6} \) and \( 1/v_T = 80 \), we can obtain the following nodal analysis equation.

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:multiphysicsProblemSet2bProblem1:20}
x + 10^-6 e^{80x} = 5 
\end{equation}

Write a program to use Newton’s method to solve this equation for x, and use the program to answer the questions below:

\makesubproblem{}{multiphysics:problemSet2b:1a}
Starting with an initial guess of \( x = 0 \), how many Newton iterations are required to compute an \( x \) that is within \( 10^{-6} \) of the exact solution?

\makesubproblem{}{multiphysics:problemSet2b:1b}
How did you determine the accuracy of your solution?

\makesubproblem{}{multiphysics:problemSet2b:1c}
Try using a simple source-stepping style continuation scheme to solve the system of equations, as in

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:multiphysicsProblemSet2bProblem1:40}
x + 10^{-6} e^{80x} = \lambda * 5,
\end{equation}

where \( \lambda \) is a continuation parameter that varies from zero to one. How many Newton iterations do you need to solve the original problem?

\makesubproblem{}{multiphysics:problemSet2b:1d}
Compare the two approaches discussed in the slides for generating an initial guess for each step of your continuation scheme. That is, compare using just the previous step’s converged solution

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:multiphysicsProblemSet2bProblem1:60}
x^0 (\lambda) = x(\lambda_{\textrm{prev}} ),
\end{equation}

to updating the converged solution using the derivative with respect to \( \lambda \), that is:

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:multiphysicsProblemSet2bProblem1:80}
x^0 (\lambda) = x(\lambda_{\textrm{prev}} ) + \frac{dx}{d\lambda} \delta \lambda.
\end{equation}

Does using the derivative help?
