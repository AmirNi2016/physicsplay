\makeproblem{Two and three-dimensional band structure and Fermi surface}{condensedMatter:problemSet9:1}{ 

Consider a two-dimensional square lattice with one atom per unit cell, 
where each atom contributes two electrons to the conduction band.  
Assume that the band structure is free-electron-like.  

\makesubproblem{}{condensedMatter:problemSet9:1a}
Show that the free-electron Fermi surface extends beyond the boundary of the 
first Brillouin zone, and state by how much the free-electron Fermi wave-vector, 
$\kF$, extends beyond the boundary.

\makesubproblem{}{condensedMatter:problemSet9:1b}

Sketch how the circular free-electron Fermi surface reconstructs due to 
  the lattice potential, assuming that the lattice potential introduces only 
  small energy gaps at the Brillouin zone boundary.  
State whether the reconstructed Fermi surfaces enclose filled states 
  (so-called ``electron pockets") or empty states (so-called ``hole pockets").

Our geometry is sketched in \cref{fig:qmSolidsPs9P1a:qmSolidsPs9P1aFig1}.

\imageFigure{qmSolidsPs9P1aFig1}{2D cubic lattice}{fig:qmSolidsPs9P1a:qmSolidsPs9P1aFig1}{0.15}

%Our lattice and reciprocal bases are
%
%\begin{equation}\label{eqn:condensedMatterProblemSet9Problem1:20}
%\begin{aligned}
%\Ba_i &\in \{a \xcap, a \ycap \} \\
%\Bg_i &\in \{\frac{2 \pi}{a} \xcap, \frac{2 \pi}{a} \ycap \}.
%\end{aligned}
%\end{equation}

With just a single atom in the primitive unit cell, the number density of the electrons is just 

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:condensedMatterProblemSet9Problem1:40}
n = \frac{N}{V} = \frac{2}{a^2}.
\end{equation}

The 2D Fermi wave-vector is given implicitly by this area number density, considering the unit circle of radius $\kF$ that can contain that number of electrons

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:condensedMatterProblemSet9Problem1:60}
N = 2 \times \pi \kF^2 \times \frac{A}{(2\pi)^2} = \frac{A \kF^2}{2 \pi},
\end{equation}

or

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:condensedMatterProblemSet9Problem1:80}
\kF = \sqrt{ 2 \pi n }.
\end{equation}

For this bivalent lattice we have

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:condensedMatterProblemSet9Problem1:100}
\kF = \sqrt{ 2 \pi \frac{2}{a^2} } = \frac{2 \sqrt{\pi} }{a} \approx \frac{3.54}{a}.
\end{dmath}

The first Brillouin zone is sketched in \cref{fig:qmSolidsPs9P1a:qmSolidsPs9P1aFig2}.

\imageFigure{qmSolidsPs9P1aFig2}{First BZ for cubic 2D lattice}{fig:qmSolidsPs9P1a:qmSolidsPs9P1aFig2}{0.2}

From the center of the BZ to the nearest point on the boundary we have a distance of

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:condensedMatterProblemSet9Problem1:120}
\frac{\pi}{a} \approx \frac{3.14}{a} < \kF
\end{equation}

So $\kF$ extends beyond the BZ boundary by

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:condensedMatterProblemSet9Problem1:140}
\myBoxed{
\kF - \frac{\pi}{a} = \frac{2 \sqrt{\pi} - \pi}{a} \approx \frac{0.40}{a}.
}
\end{equation}

\makeSubAnswer{}{condensedMatter:problemSet9:1b}

The BZ and the Fermi circle has been plotted to scale, with the reconstruction surfaces sketched over top of the plot in \cref{fig:qmSolidsPs9P1b:qmSolidsPs9P1bFig1pnSurface}.

\imageFigure{qmSolidsPs9P1bFig1pnSurface}{Fermi surface for 2D cubic lattice}{fig:qmSolidsPs9P1b:qmSolidsPs9P1bFig1pnSurface}{0.2}

Sketching the repeated zone scheme rather roughly (no longer to scale) in \cref{fig:qmSolidsPs9P1b:qmSolidsPs9P1bFig2}, it's easier to visualize the disconnected pockets of (blue) enclosing unfilled states (hole pockets).
