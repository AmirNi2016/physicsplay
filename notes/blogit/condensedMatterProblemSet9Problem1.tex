\makeproblem{Two and three-dimensional band structure and Fermi surface}{condensedMatter:problemSet9:1}{ 

Consider a two-dimensional square lattice with one atom per unit cell, 
where each atom contributes two electrons to the conduction band.  
Assume that the band structure is free-electron-like.  

\makesubproblem{}{condensedMatter:problemSet9:1a}
Show that the free-electron Fermi surface extends beyond the boundary of the 
first Brillouin zone, and state by how much the free-electron Fermi wave-vector, 
$\kF$, extends beyond the boundary.

\makesubproblem{}{condensedMatter:problemSet9:1b}

Sketch how the circular free-electron Fermi surface reconstructs due to 
  the lattice potential, assuming that the lattice potential introduces only 
  small energy gaps at the Brillouin zone boundary.  
State whether the reconstructed Fermi surfaces enclose filled states 
  (so-called ``electron pockets") or empty states (so-called ``hole pockets").
