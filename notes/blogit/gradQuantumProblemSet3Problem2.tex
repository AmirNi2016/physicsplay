 Landau Levels - Symmetric gauge (5 points)
Consider a charged particle moving in two dimensions (xy-plane) in a uniform magnetic field \( B_0 \zcap \) perpendicular
to the plane. Let us work in a different gauge from the Landau gauge we discussed in class, namely, let us set

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:gradQuantumProblemSet3Problem2:n}
\BA = \frac{B}{2} \lr{ x \ycap - y \xcap },
\end{dmath}

where \( (x,y) \) denotes the particle position. This is called the `symmetric gauge'. In this gauge, work
out the energy spectrum, the eigenfunctions, and provide a crude counting of the number of states per energy level
(i.e., the degeneracy) for an electron on a disk of radius \( R \).
