\makeproblem{Gaussian beam (2010 final exam q5)}{pr:optics2010ExamGaussian:1}{

\makesubproblem{Spot size}{modernOptics:optics2010ExamGaussian:a}

A Gaussian beam with wavelength $0.8 \mu \text{m}$ has its minimum waist of $0.5 \text{m m}$ located in the middle of a parallel glass plate of thickness $5 \text{c m}$ and refractive index $1.5$.  The axis of the beam is perpendicular to the surfaces of the glass plate.  The beaam emerges from the glass plate and strikes a mirror at normal incidence $10 \text{c m}$ away.  When the beam passes back through its original location what is its spot size?

\makesubproblem{Angular divergence}{modernOptics:optics2010ExamGaussian:b}

When the beam emerges from the plate again after re-passing its beam waist, what is its angular divergence?
