\section{Maxwell's equation review}.

We work with electric AND magnetic charge densities.

In engineering we call:

E,H : primary fields
D,B : induced

FIXME: Start with standard form, and derive the phasor forms of the equations.

%E,H,D,B,M,J,D,B, \rho_m, \rho_m

FIXME: 
\section{Constituativity relations}

See slides.

In AM radio, will see ferrite cores with the inductors, which introduces non-unit \( \mu_r \).  This is to increase the radiation resistance.

\section{Boundary conditions}

For good electric conductor \( \BE = 0 \).
For good magnetic conductor \( \BB = 0 \).

\section{Notation}

\begin{itemize}
\item Phasor frequency terms are written as \( e^{j \omega t} \), not \( e^{-j \omega t} \), as done in physics.  I didn't recall this, and wouldn't have assumed it.  This is the case in both \citep{jackson1975cew:simpleRadiating} and \citep{griffiths1999introduction:waves}.  The latter however, also uses \( \cos(\omega t - k r) \) for spherical waves possibly implying an alternate phasor sign convention in that content, so I'd be wary about trusting any absolute ``engineering'' vs. physics sign convention without checking carefully.
\item Prof's J looks like pi with a tail.
\end{itemize}
