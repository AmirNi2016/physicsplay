\section{Maxwell's equation review}.

We work with electric AND magnetic charge densities.

In engineering we call:

E,H : primary fields
D,B : induced

FIXME: Start with standard form, and derive the phasor forms of the equations.

%E,H,D,B,M,J,D,B, \rho_m, \rho_m

FIXME: 
\section{Constituativity relations}

See slides.

In AM radio, will see ferrite cores with the inductors, which introduces non-unit \( \mu_r \).  This is to increase the radiation resistance.

\section{Boundary conditions}

For good electric conductor \( \BE = 0 \).
For good magnetic conductor \( \BB = 0 \).
