This is my first set of notes for the UofT course ECE1229, Advanced Antenna Theory, taught by Prof. Eleftheriades, covering \chaptext 3 \citep{balanis2005antenna} content.

Unlike most of the other classes I have taken, I am not attempting to take comprehensive notes for this class.  The class is taught on slides that match the textbook so closely, there is little value to me taking notes that just replicate the text.  Instead, I am annotating my copy of textbook with little details instead.  My usual notes collection for the class will contain musings of details that were unclear, or in some cases, details that were provided in class, but are not in the text (and too long to pencil into my book.)

\section{Maxwell's equation review}.

We work with electric AND magnetic charge densities.

In engineering we call:

E,H : primary fields
D,B : induced

FIXME: Start with standard form, and derive the phasor forms of the equations.

%E,H,D,B,M,J,D,B, \rho_m, \rho_m

FIXME: 
\section{Constituativity relations}

See slides.

In AM radio, will see ferrite cores with the inductors, which introduces non-unit \( \mu_r \).  This is to increase the radiation resistance.

\section{Boundary conditions}

For good electric conductor \( \BE = 0 \).
For good magnetic conductor \( \BB = 0 \).

\section{Notation}

\begin{itemize}
\item Phasor frequency terms are written as \( e^{j \omega t} \), not \( e^{-j \omega t} \), as done in physics.  I didn't recall this, and wouldn't have assumed it.  This is the case in both \citep{jackson1975cew:simpleRadiating} and \citep{griffiths1999introduction:waves}.  The latter however, also uses \( \cos(\omega t - k r) \) for spherical waves possibly implying an alternate phasor sign convention in that content, so I'd be wary about trusting any absolute ``engineering'' vs. physics sign convention without checking carefully.
\item Prof's J looks like pi with a tail.
\end{itemize}
FIXME: Prof's \( \lambda \) should be here too...pretty whacky.
