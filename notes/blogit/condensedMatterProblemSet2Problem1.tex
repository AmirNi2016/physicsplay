\makeproblem{Essay about bonding, structure and melting points}{condensedMatter:problemSet2:1}{ 

Explain how trends in melting points in the periodic table 
might be explained in terms of the relationship between the 
type of bonding and the character of the valence electrons. 

For the melting points see the periodic table handed out in the 
first lecture, which can also be found at: 

\href{http://www.sciencegeek.net/tables/lbltable.pdf}{http://www.sciencegeek.net/tables/lbltable.pdf}

Specifically discuss melting points of (a) the alkalai 
metals (the first column of the periodic table not 
including hydrogen); (b) the noble gases (the last 
column of the periodic table); (c) boron and carbon; 
(d) oxygen and nitrogen; and (e) the transition metals. 

You should write around 300 words (or more).
