Consider a heavy nucleus of mass number $A$.  i.e., having $A$ total nucleons including neutrons and protons.  Assume that the number of neutrons and protons is equal, and recall that each of them has spin-$1/2$ (so possessing two spin states).  Treating these nucleons as a free ideal Fermi gas of uniform density contained in a radius $R = r_0 A^{1/3}$, where $r_0 = 1.4 \times 10^{-13} \text{cm}$, calculate the Fermi energy and the average energy per nucleon in MeV.
