Consider a heavy nucleus of mass number A. i.e., having A total nucleons including neutrons and protons. Assume
that the number of neutrons and protons is equal, and recall that each of them has spin-1/2 (so possessing two spin
states). Treating these nucleons as a simply free ideal Fermi gas of uniform density contained in a radius R = r0A1/3,
where r0= 1.4×10-13cm, calculate the Fermi energy and the average energy per nucleon in MeV. (From: K. Huang,
prob 16.2).
