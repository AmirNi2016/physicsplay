\section{Motivation.}

In \cite{desai2009quantum} the gauge transformation of the Dirac equation is covered, producing the non-relativisitic equation with the correct spin interaction.  There are unfortunately some sign errors, some of which self correct, and some of which don't impact the end result, but are slightly confusing.  There are also some ommitted details.  I'll attempt to work through the same calculation with all the signs in the right places and also fill in some of the details I found myself wanting.

\section{A step back.  On the gauge transformation.}

The gauge transformations utilized are given as

\begin{align}\label{eqn:diracGauge:n}
E &\rightarrow E - e \phi \\
\Bp &\rightarrow \Bp - e \BA.
\end{align}

Let's start off by reminding ourself where these come from.  I've seen $e(\phi,\BA)$ gauge transformations in two places.  One of these was the Klein-Gordon equation, for which the Lagrangian, and field equation respectively are

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:diracGauge:n}
\LL = \frac{m^2 c^2}{\hbar^2} \psi^\conj \psi - \partial_\mu \psi \partial^\mu \psi^\conj,
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:diracGauge:n}
\end{equation}
