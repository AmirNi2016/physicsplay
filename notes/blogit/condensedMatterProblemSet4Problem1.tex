\makeproblem{Laue vs.\ powder diffraction (based on assigned reading, \S 3.7, pp.\ 69-70)}{condensedMatter:problemSet4:1}{ 
You are given a single crystal of an unknown material and asked to determine the 
lattice constants.  Should you use Laue or powder x-ray diffraction to 
do this?  Explain why.   (Note that in order to do powder diffraction you would  
have to crush the single crystal.  Assume that you are allowed to do this.)
