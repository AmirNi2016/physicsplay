\section{Motivation.}

Here's one of the problems from \S 2 of \cite{acheson1990elementary}, a slight variation on what we did in class.  It seemed to me that it would be a good midterm prep problem to try.

\section{Steady state inclined flow down a plane of two layers of incompressible viscous equal density fluids.}

Our problem is illustrated in 

FIXME: F4

with a plane set at angle $\alpha$, fluid depths of $h^{(1)}$ and $h^{(2)}$ respectively, and viscosities $\mu^{(1)}$ and $\mu^{(2)}$.  We'll write $H = h^{(1)} + h^{(2)}$.  We have a pair of Navier-Stokes equations to solve

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:twoLayerInclinedFlow:n}
\rho \ddt{\Bu^{(i)}} = \rho \PD{t}{\Bu^{(i)}} + \rho (\Bu^{(i)} \cdot \spacegrad) \Bu^{(i)} = - \spacegrad p^{(i)} + \mu^{(i)} \spacegrad^2 \Bu^{(i)} + \mu^{(i)} \spacegrad (\spacegrad \cdot \Bu^{(i)}) + \rho \Bg
\end{equation}

Our steady state and incompressiblity constraints break this into a few independent equations

\begin{align}\label{eqn:twoLayerInclinedFlow:n}
\rho \PD{t}{\Bu^{(i)}} &= 0 \\
\spacegrad \cdot \Bu^{(i)} &= 0 \\
\rho (\Bu^{(i)} \cdot \spacegrad) \Bu^{(i)} &= - \spacegrad p^{(i)} + \mu^{(i)} \spacegrad^2 \Bu^{(i)} + \rho \Bg
\end{align}

Let's require that we initially have no components of the flows in the $y$, or $z$ directions.  As the equivalent of Newton's law for fluid flows, conservation of linear momentum requires that for our steady state problem we have $u_y = u_z = 0$ for the flows in both fluid layers.  Our problem is now reduced to a problem in four quanties (two velocities and two pressures).  We can restate Navier-Stokes in coordinate form as

\begin{align}\label{eqn:twoLayerInclinedFlow:n}
\partial_x u^{(i)}(x,y,z) &= 0 \\
\rho (u^{(i)} \partial_x u^{(i)} &= - \partial_x p^{(i)} + \mu^{(i)} (\partial_{xx} + \partial_{yy} + \partial_{zz}) u^{(i)} + \rho g \sin\alpha \\
0 &= - \partial_y p^{(i)} \rho \Bg - \rho g \cos\alpha \\
0 &= - \partial_z p^{(i)} 
\end{align}

In order to solve this, we have eight simultaneous non-linear PDEs, four unknown functions, plus boundary conditions to consider!

What are the boundary conditions?  One is the ``no-slip'' condition, the experimental observation that velocites match at the interfaces.  So we should have zero velocity for the fluid lying against the plane, and velocity matching between the fluids.  The air above the fluid will also be flowing along at the rate of the uppermost portion of the top layer, but we'll neglect that effect (i.e. considering two layers of equal density and not three, with one having a separate density).  We also have matching of the traction vectors at the interfaces.  

FIXME: I'm not sure that I fully understand what motivated that last boundary value condition, and will have to go back and review my notes for that.

FIXME: should go back and think about momentum conservation in the context of fluids.  I'm now so used to thinking about this as a symmetry issue from a Lagrangian context.  With no Lagrangian here, what would be a robust way treat this in fluids?  What is the Lagrangian for a fluid mechanics system?  I'd imagine that it would be possible to set up a field Lagrangian with velocity fields.
