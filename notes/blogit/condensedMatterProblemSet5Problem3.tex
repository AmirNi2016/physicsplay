\makeproblem{Debye calculation in two dimensions}{condensedMatter:problemSet5:3}{ 
Repeat the Debye theory calculation that we did in class, but for a 
two-dimensional lattice.  Assume (quite artificially) that the atoms 
are free to move only within the plane, so that there are $2rN$ degrees 
of freedom,  and there is only one transverse acoustic 
phonon mode, instead of two as in the three-dimensional calculation.

Show that the low temperature limit of the specific heat at constant 
area, per unit area, is:
\begin{eqnarray*}
c_A(T) = 7.213\, \frac{4rN}{A}\,k_B\,\frac{T^2}{\Theta^2},
\end{eqnarray*}
where $A$ is the area of the crystal, $rN$ is the number of atoms 
in the crystal, 
$\Theta$ is defined by $k_B\Theta = \hbar\omega_D$, 
and 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{y^3 e^y}{(e^y-1)^2}\,dy \simeq 7.213. 
\end{eqnarray*}
