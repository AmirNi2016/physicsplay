\section{Abstract.}

Perhaps because special relativity is taught in a highly coordinate centric fashion, some of the linear algebra toolbox available to the student, is not applied to this study.  The concepts of basis and change of basis are powerful tools for the study of vector algebraic systems in Euclidean spaces.  There is nothing inherent in the study of special relativity that requires the concept of basis to be avoided and it will be shown here some nice conceptual advantages to including the basis along with the coordinates.  Lorentz transformations can be seen as change of basis matrices, and can be calculated using basic vector algebra techniques such as the Graham-Schmidt orthonormalization algorithm.

\section{Preliminaries.  Basis and reciprocal basis, and relation to coordinates.}

\section{Lorentz boost}

%The matrix expression for a Lorentz boost, a linear transformation that maintains the invariant Minkowski norm, can be derived in many ways.
