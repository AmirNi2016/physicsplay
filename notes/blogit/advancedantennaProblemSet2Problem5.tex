\makeproblem{Mobile power reception.}{advancedantenna:problemSet2:5}{ 

A mobile is located 5 \si{km} from a base station and uses a vertical wire antenna of gain 2.55 \si{dB} to receive cellular radio signals.
The carrier frequency used is 900 \si{MHz} and the EIRP of the base station is 30 \si{mW}.
If the base station and mobile are located 50 \si{m} and 1.5 \si{m} above ground respectively, calculate the power level received at the mobile.
