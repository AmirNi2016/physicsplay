\makeproblem{description}{advancedantenna:problemSet1:2}{ 
A satellite dish has a diameter \( d = 1.5 \si{m} \) and an aperture efficiency of 70\%. Calculate the
directivity of the dish at 12 \si{GHz}. If the distance from a geostationary satellite is 37,000
\si{km} calculate the corresponding free-space loss in \si{dB}.
