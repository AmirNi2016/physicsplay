\makeproblem{Density matrix}{gradQuantum:problemSet1:1}{ 

Consider a spin-1/2 particle. The Hilbert space is two-dimensional, let us label the two states as \( \ket{\uparrow} \) and \( \ket{\downarrow} \).
Write down the \( 2 \times 2 \) density matrix which corresponds to the following pure states.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \( \ket{\uparrow} \)
\item \( \inv{\sqrt{2}} \lr{ \ket{\uparrow} + \ket{\downarrow} } \)
\item \( \inv{\sqrt{2}} \lr{ \ket{\uparrow} + i \ket{\downarrow} } \)
\item At time \( t = 0 \), let us start with the state \( \inv{\sqrt{2}} \lr{ \ket{\uparrow} + \ket{\downarrow} } \), 
and consider time-evolution under the Hamiltonian \( H = - B S_z \),
where \( S_z \) is the z-component of the spin operator. 
This leads to eigenstates \( \ket{\uparrow} \) with energy \( -B \Hbar/2 \), and
\( \ket{\downarrow} \)
with energy \( +B \Hbar/2 \). 
The state
\( \inv{\sqrt{2}} \lr{ \ket{\uparrow} + \ket{\downarrow} } \) 
is not an eigenstate of this Hamiltonian and it will evolve in time.
Find the state and the corresponding \( 2 \times 2 \) density matrix of this system at a later time \( t \).
\end{enumerate}
