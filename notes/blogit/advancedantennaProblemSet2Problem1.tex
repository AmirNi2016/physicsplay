Consider a flat rectangular metallic plate of physical area \( A_\txtp \) (\si{m^2}). The incident normal power density is \( W_\txti \) (\si{W/m^2}).
Now consider the plate as a receiving and retransmitting antenna having an effective aperture equal to its physical area (the plate is electrically large). Based on this idea, show that approximately the radar scattering cross section (RCS) of the plate is given by

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:advancedantennaProblemSet2Problem1:20}
\sigma = \frac{ 4 \pi A_\txtp^2}{\lambda^2},
\end{dmath}

as we have seen in class.
