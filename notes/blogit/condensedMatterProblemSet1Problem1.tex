({\em The reading assignments covered sections 1, 1.1, 1.5 and 1.6 of Ibach and Luth.}) 

\makesubproblem{Explain $5s$ $4d$ orbital filling ordering.}{condensedMatter:problemSet1:1a}

In a hydrogenic atom (nuclear charge $Ze$, only one electron) 
the $4d$ levels have a lower energy than the 
$5s$ levels.  According to the periodic table, however, the $5s$ levels become 
occupied before the $4d$ levels do. Explain why.

\makesubproblem{Explain power of Van der Waals potential.}{condensedMatter:problemSet1:1b}

Briefly explain why the Van der Waals potential has a $1/r^6$ dependence.
