%Peeter's lecture notes from class.  These may be incoherent and rough.

These are notes for the UofT course ECE1229, Advanced Antenna Theory, taught by Prof. Eleftheriades, covering \chaptext 4 \citep{balanis2005antenna} content.

Unlike most of the other classes I have taken, I am not attempting to take comprehensive notes for this class.  The class is taught on slides that match the textbook so closely, there is little value to me taking notes that just replicate the text.  Instead, I am annotating my copy of textbook with little details instead.  My usual notes collection for the class will contain musings of details that were unclear, or in some cases, details that were provided in class, but are not in the text (and too long to pencil into my book.)
