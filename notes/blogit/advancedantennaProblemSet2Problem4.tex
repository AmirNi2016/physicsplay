\makeproblem{description}{advancedantenna:problemSet2:4}{ 

Show that in the near field \( k r \rightarrow 0 \), the electric field of an infinitesimal electrical dipole of length \( l \) and current \( \BI = I \zcap \) can be derived from the field of an electric dipole moment \( \Bp = q l \zcap \). The electrostatic field of a dipole moment is given by,

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:advancedantennaProblemSet2Problem4:20}
\BE = \frac{ 3 \lr{ \Bp \cdot \rcap } \rcap - \Bp}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r^3}.
\end{dmath}
