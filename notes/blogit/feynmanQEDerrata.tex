\section{Motivation.}

I got a nice present today which included one of \href{http://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Electrodynamics-Advanced-Book-Classics/dp/0201360756/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1275092228&sr=8-1}{Feynman's QED books}.  I noticed some early mistakes, and since I can't find an errata page anywhere, I'll collect them here.

\section{Third Lecture}
\subsection{Page 6 typos.}

The electric field is given in terms of only the scalar potential
\begin{align*}
\BE = -\spacegrad \phi + \partial \phi/ \partial t,
\end{align*}

and should be
\begin{align*}
\BE = -\spacegrad \phi - \inv{c} \partial \BA/ \partial t.
\end{align*}

The invariant gauge transformation for the vector and scalar potentials are given as

\begin{align*}
\BA' &= \BA = \spacegrad \chi \\
\phi' &= \phi + \partial \chi / \partial t
\end{align*}

But these should be
\begin{align*}
\BA' &= \BA + \spacegrad \chi \\
\phi' &= \phi - \inv{c} \partial \chi / \partial t
\end{align*}

The sign was crossed on the scalar potential transformation.  Feynman is also probably used to using $c=1$, but he doesn't do that explicitly at a different point on the page, so including it here is proper.

\section{Second Lecture}

This isn't errata, but I found the following required slight exploration.  He gives (implicitly)

\begin{align*}
\overline{\sin^2(\omega t - \BK \cdot \Bx)} = \inv{2}
\end{align*}

Is this an average over space and time?  How would one do that?  What do we get just integrating this over the volume?  That dot product is $\BK \cdot \Bx = 2 \pi \left(\frac{m}{\lambda_1} x + \frac{n}{\lambda_2} y + \frac{o}{\lambda_3} z \right)$.  Our average over the volume, for $m \ne 0$, using \href{http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=\int+sin^2(a+x+%2B+b)+dx}{wolfram alpha to do the dirty work}, is then

\begin{align*}
&\inv{\lambda_1 \lambda_2 \lambda_3} 
\int_{z=0}^{\lambda_3} dz
\int_{y=0}^{\lambda_2} dy
\int_{x=0}^{\lambda_1}
dx \sin^2 \left( 
-\frac{2 \pi m x}{\lambda_1} 
-\frac{2 \pi n y}{\lambda_2} 
-\frac{2 \pi o z}{\lambda_3} 
+ \omega t \right) \\
&=
\inv{\lambda_1 \lambda_2 \lambda_3} 
\int_{z=0}^{\lambda_3} dz
\int_{y=0}^{\lambda_2} dy
{\left.
\frac{-\lambda_1}{4 \pi m} \left( 
-\frac{2 \pi m }{\lambda_1} x 
-\frac{2 \pi n y}{\lambda_2} 
-\frac{2 \pi o z}{\lambda_3} 
+ \omega t \right)
\right\vert}_{x=0}^{\lambda_1} \\
&-
\inv{\lambda_1 \lambda_2 \lambda_3} 
\int_{z=0}^{\lambda_3} dz
\int_{y=0}^{\lambda_2} dy
{\left.
\frac{-\lambda_1}{8 \pi m} 
\sin \left( 2 \left(
-\frac{2 \pi m }{\lambda_1} x 
-\frac{2 \pi n y}{\lambda_2} 
-\frac{2 \pi o z}{\lambda_3} 
+ \omega t \right) \right)
\right\vert}_{x=0}^{\lambda_1}
\end{align*}

Since the sine integral vanishes, we have just $1/2$ as expected regardless of the angular frequency $\omega$.  Okay, that makes sense now.  Looks like $\omega$ is only relavent for the single $\BK = 0$ Fourier component, but that likely doesn't matter since I seem to recall that the $\BK = 0$ fourier component of this oscillators in a box problem was entirely constant (and perhaps zero?).
