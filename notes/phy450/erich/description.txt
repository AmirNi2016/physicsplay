in problem 3, if you decide use the stress tensor and look at the solution given in L&amp;L, the stress tensor is argued to be T^{alpha beta} = T^{alpha beta}(incoming wave) + T^{alpha beta}(reflected wave). This actually holds only for the components of T where one index, i.e., \alpha is the direction perpendicular to the wall (i.e. for the components of the stress tensor relevant for calculating the pressure and shear). To be completely happy with the use of the stress tensor, you may want to derive this fact, starting from the expressions for the electric and magnetic field (3-vectors) E=E1 + E2, B=B1+B2, where E1(2) and B1(2) correspond to the incoming (reflected) wave, noticing that |E(2)| = \sqrt{R}|E(1)|, just like you did for Problem 1.5 (HW6). Also, see Problem 3 of HW5.
