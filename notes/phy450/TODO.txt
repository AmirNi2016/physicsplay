- Give this a re-read and see what state it is in.

- Don't think I ever did any figures for this class.  Unfortunately too much work to retrofit them.

- convert this to exersize env, and then change part (.) references to hyperlinks.

./phy450/problems/relElectroDynProblemSet1.tex:152:Note that for $u = c$, we have $\Bv^2 = c^2$, regardless of the direction of $\BV$ with respect to the motion of the particle in the unprimed frame.  This should not be surprising since this light like invariance is exactly what the Lorentz transformation is designed to maintain.  It is however slightly comforting to know that the algebra appears to be still be kosher after all this.  This also answers part (b) of this question, since we have tackled the $v = c$ case in the primed frame, and seen that the speed remains $v = c$ in the unprimed frame (and thus any frame moving at constant speed relative to another).

- switch $$ -> \( \) [want to do that globally if possible]

- after switch to the exersize env interleave the problems into the text where relavant.

- incorporate my little arxiv paper content as an appendix.
