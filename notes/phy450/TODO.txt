- dead reference commented out:

   gabook:stokesNoTensor

  I purged that chapter from gabook.  Is any of the stuff that references it valid?  

- dead url:

@webpage{ nasaGPS,
   author = "unknown",
   title = "How does GPS work",
   year = "2011",
   url = "http://www.nasm.si.edu/gps/work.html",
   note = "[Online; accessed 24-Jan-2011]"
 }

- Give this a re-read and see what state it is in.

- Don't think I ever did any figures for this class.  Unfortunately too much work to retrofit them.

- exersize env:
  o   change part (.) references to hyperlinks.
  o   use makeoproblem to mark with original problem set numbers and parts.

- switch $$ -> \( \) [want to do that globally if possible]

- incorporate my little arxiv paper content as an appendix.

- bib not showing up anymore?

- url references to poppitz notes now all stale.  delete or update?

- move the tutorial content either to appendices or into the chapters they belong with.

- flatten the chapters so that no more than section is in any of the chapter bookmark views.
