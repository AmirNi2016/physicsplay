- Give this a re-read and see what state it is in.

- Don't think I ever did any figures for this class.  Unfortunately too much work to retrofit them.

- convert this to exersize env, and then change part (.) references to hyperlinks.

- switch $$ -> \( \) [want to do that globally if possible]

- after switch to the exersize env interleave the problems into the text where relavant.

- incorporate my little arxiv paper content as an appendix.

- use makeoproblem to mark with original problem set numbers and parts.

- bib not showing up anymore?

- url references to poppitz notes now all stale.
