This document contains a few things

\begin{itemize}
\item My personal lecture notes for the Spring 2011, University of Relativistic Electrodynamics course (PHY450H1S), taught by Prof.\ Erich Poppitz.

Typos, if any, are probably mine (Peeter), and no claim nor attempt of spelling or grammar correctness will be made.  The text for the course is \cite{landau1980classical}.

\item Notes from reading of the text.

\item Some assigned problems, at least the parts of them that I did not hand write.  %I've corrected some the errors after recieving grading feedback, and where I haven't done so I at least recorded some of the grading comments as a reference.
%  This includes observations, notes on what seem like errors, and some solved problems.  None of these problems have been graded.
%
%
%\item Some worked problems associated with exam preparation.
\end{itemize}
