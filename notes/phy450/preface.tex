This document contains a few things

\begin{itemize}
\item My personal lecture notes for the Spring 2011, University of Relativistic Electrodynamics course (PHY450H1S), taught by Prof.\ Erich Poppitz, and Simon Freedman.

Typos, if any, are probably mine (Peeter), and no claim nor attempt of spelling or grammar correctness will be made.  The text for the course is \cite{landau1980classical}.

These notes track along with the Professor's hand written notes very closely, since his lectures follow his notes very closely.  While I used the note taking exersize as a way to verify that I understood all the day's lecture materials, the Professor's notes are in many instances a much better study resource (but unfortunately I find it harder to read the scanned images).  There are details that he covers there that are were not covered in the lectures.

\item Some notes from reading of the text.  One of the earlier of these was due to unfortunate use of an older edition of the text, where the use of upper and lower index quantities had not made it into the book.

\item Some assigned problems, at least the parts of them that I did not hand write.  I've corrected some the errors after recieving grading feedback, and where I haven't done so I at least recorded some of the grading comments as a reference.  Not all the problems were grades, so I make no guarentees of correctness.

%  This includes observations, notes on what seem like errors, and some solved problems.

%\item Some worked problems associated with exam preparation.
