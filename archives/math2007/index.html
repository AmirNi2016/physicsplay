</p>

<p>This and the other October docs below are all based on very ad-hoc notes I dumped into the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_algebra">
Wikipedia Geometric algebra page
</a>
, which had very little actual content in it. As I tried to learn GA
from the much too advanced treatments I found on the web, I put my
notes in the wiki as I puzzled things out myself. Eventually I bought
some books and if I had done so earlier, I wouldn’t have needed to
figure out a lot of this on my own. It was however time well spent as I
learned things more thoroughly trying to figure it out from the basic
properties. I wanted to add details to the wiki pages that didn’t
really fit with a wiki page, or were hard to do with wiki markup
compared to latex, so eventually I stopped trying to make my notes in
wiki and just typed them up directly here. I never did go back and see
if there was anything extra that I added to these that would be worth
re-adding to the wiki pages. What I have here is all based on my wiki
page additions (and I was the only contributor at the time), and
excludes the minimal bits that were there previously.</p>

</p>

<p>Angular velocity as radial component of velocity. Kepler’s law from
Salas/Hille reworked with GA. Acceleration, and circular motion special
case expressed in GA form, noting how close that ends up being to the
scalar equivalent, but vector product and inversion encodes the
direction too.</p>

<a href="../sites/geometric-algebra/maxwells_ga.pdf">Maxwell’s equations expressed with Geometric Algebra.</a>
</p>

<p>Taking the hint that Maxwell’s equations could be expressed
naturally using GA. I didn’t get it as far as the GAFP book since I
didn’t see how to also formulate the spacetime gradient in the STA
basis. This is probably a treatment that can be understood without too
much GA prep.</p>

<a href="../sites/geometric-algebra/ga_wiki_cramers.pdf">Cramer’s rule using wedge products.</a>
</p>

<p>An example showing how Cramer’s rule is just a special case of
linear equation solution using the wedge product. Hestenes uses
examples like this in his book. Without using GA, <a href="http://www.grassmannalgebra.info/grassmannalgebra/book/index.htm">the grassman algebra book</a>
also has a worked example of this which is nice. I find the GA approach
is easier to understand than the Grassman book approach. The grassman
book avoids the dot product to use the metric free regressive product
approach. I find the explicit use of the metric and associated dot
product in GA more naturally when trying to bridge from traditional
vector identities to a wedge product treatment.</p>

<a href="../sites/cross/cross.pdf">The cross product in three and more dimensions</a>
</p>

<p>Revisiting my cross product treatment, but after discovering
differential forms and the wedge product (Harley Flanders.
“Differential forms and Applications to the Physical Sciences”). This
was curtosy of Tor who was smart enough to search for it. </p>

<p>I had trouble with relating the wedge product on differential
quantities to vectors. I could see this was related to my old attempt
to generalize the vector dot product. I went back to my old notes and
tried to lead from those ideas to the wedge product in a natural way.</p>

<p>This doc contains a few interesting bits. </p>

<p>A coordinate description of vector rejection (difference from
projection) in terms of determinants is developed. This provides a way
to calculate the normal component of a vector with respect to a
spanning set.</p>

<p>This is used to calculate the area and volume of an N dimensional hyper-parallelogram, or hyper-parallopiped.</p>

<p>Also included is a calculation of a general normal to a set of
vectors based on Null space calculation. Of particular interest is the
description of the case when such a normal cannot necessarily be
unambiguously defined.</p>

<p>The ideas here are then used to try to intuitively introduce the
wedge product and a dot product on pairs of wedge products, without
also introducing differentials. The wedge product and the normal and
rejection concepts are all related by the determinant (in fact the
determinant really ought to be viewed as generated by the wedge
product).</p>

<p>I end with an poor attempt to introduce differential forms for
geometric area and volume elements. When attempting to find a treatment
of differnential forms that I could understand I ended up discovering
Geometric Algebra. That subject has exactly what I was looking for as
the “answer” for all this generalized vector algebra. Due to the time
required to study that algebraic toolbox I have not yet gotten back to
the differential forms that started me down that path. Soon I hope.</p>

</p>

<p>Integral and differential forms of Maxwell’s equations in
differential, and integral form, as well as explicit normal and
tangential form (as in my Dad’s old 1960s Encyclopedia Britanica).
Derivation of the wave equation in free space and in presence of matter
using the normal triple cross product vector relation identity method.
Followup with a four vector complex number treatment that puts the
equations in a much more symmetrical form, that highlights the complex
number factor that is naturally associated with the magnetic field. </p>

<p>I later followed up on this idea of complex representation in more
detail in an email to Tor (at which point I got excited about it and
wondered why this wasn’t in all the E&amp;M books since it was so
simple and natural and appropriate seeming). I should dig up and write
that up since it would be a nice bridge to the GA ideas.</p>

<p>Circa ~1999
<a href="../sites/cross-1-15/cross_1_15.pdf">Old cross product generalization musings.</a>
</p>

<p>The three dimensionality (and even non-2 dimensionality) of the
cross product always bugged me. I never saw any hint (or if I did I
didn’t recognize it) about existing generalizations or
degeneralizations of the cross product, even with four years of
Engineering classes. So, one day I felt like “mathing” as my wife and
kids call now it, and played with generalizing it.</p>

<p>Starting point was looking at torque in a plane (aka: Feynman
Lectures, Vol I), and considering the work done by an incremental
rotation, then doing the same for three dimensions. You end up with the
cross product as an operator, and it takes the form of a completely
antisymmetric matrix. I now know that this naturally expresses the
antisymmetry of the wedge product (ie: cross product as the dual of a
bivector).</p>

<p>In these notes I attempted to take this cross product operator form
and extract some of the structure. In particular I factored this
antisymmetric matrix into the product of diagonal and permutation
product matrixes, and tried to use that as a way to define a
generalized cross product. I was able to create a 4D cross product
generalization in matrix form that had at least some of the 3D cross
product properties (and properties of the 2D de-generalization of the
cross product). However, the core problem here is that one doesn’t know
how to define the normal that is intrinsic to the cross product, so the
whole approach is kind of busted.</p>

<p>After starting with generalizing the cross product using incremental
rotation as a starting point, I went back to the other starting point
in the cross product definition, where the cross product is defined in
terms of Euclidean normal vector properties (where one such orientation
of the general normal between two vectors is picked).</p>

<p>There is a final attempt to generalize this further to 5D, but I
don’t think I did a particularily good job at it. The most notable
issue is that the 4D version wasn’t really well defined, and worse, I
invented a 4D cross product generalization that I didn’t know any
applications for.</p>

<p>Perhaps even worse than inventing a cross product generalization for
was that I spent a bunch of time working out stuff that others had
already figured out much more completely than I, and I didn’t go
looking to see what others had done first to ensure I wasn’t (badly)
reinventing the wheel. My friend <a href="http://www.ece.ubc.ca/%7Eaamodt/">
Tor Aamodt
</a>
(Prof at UBC), says this is one of the biggest reasons that grad
students have thesis advisors. If I had stayed in school and done this
in an academic context I would have had the good fortune to have
somebody help point out that I was wasting time.</p>

<p>The final bits in this (long) set of notes was as far as I went with
these ideas for quite a while and ended up dropping math as a hobby
again for a number of years.</p>
