Dec 21, 2009 <a href="ftMaxVacuum.pdf">Energy and momentum for assumed Fourier transform solutions to the homogeneous Maxwell equation.</a><br>
Fourier transform instead of series treatment of
 the previous, determining the Hamiltonian like energy expression for a wave packet.<br>
<br>

Dec 16, 2009 <a href="fourierMaxVac.pdf">Electrodynamic field energy for vacuum.</a><br>
Apply the previous complex energy momentum tensor results to the calculation that Bohm does in his QM book for vacuum energy of a periodic electromagnetic field.  I'd tried to do this a couple times using complex exponentials and never really gotten it right because of attempting to use the pseudoscalar as the imaginary for the phasors, instead of introducing a completely separate commuting imaginary.  The end result is an energy expression for the volume element that has the structure of a mechanical Hamiltonian.<br>
<br>

Dec 13, 2009 <a href="complexFieldEnergy.pdf">Energy and momentum for Complex electric and magnetic field phasors.</a><br>
Work out the conservation equations for the energy and Poynting vectors in a complex representation.  This fills in some gaps in Jackson, but tackles the problem from a GA starting point.<br>

<br>

Dec 1, 2009 <a href="polarGradAndLaplacian.pdf">Polar form for the gradient and Laplacian.</a><br>
Explore a chain rule derivation of the polar form of the Laplacian, and the validity of my old First year Proffessor's statements about divergence of the gradient being the only way to express the general Laplacian.  His insistence that the grad dot grad not being generally valid is reconciled here with reality, and the key is that the action on the unit vectors also has to be considered.<br>

Nov 4, 2009 <a href="multiPendulumSpherical2.pdf">Spherical polar pendulum for one and multiple masses (Take II)</a><br>
The constraints required to derive the equations of motion from a bivector parameterized Lagrangian for the multiple spherical pendulum make the problem considerably more complicated than would be the case with a plain scalar parameterization.  Take the previous multiple spherical pendulum and rework it with only scalar spherical polar angles.  I later rework this once more removing all the geometric algebra, which simplifies it further.<br>
<br>

Oct 27, 2009 <a href="sPolarMultiPendulum.pdf">Spherical polar pendulum for one and multiple masses, and multivector Euler-Lagrange formulation.</a><br>
Derive the multivector Euler-Lagrange relationships.  These were given in Doran/Lasenby but I did not understand it there.  Apply these to the multiple spherical pendulum with the Lagrangian expressed in terms of a bivector angle containing all the phi dependence a scalar polar angle.<br>

Got my "new" second hand 2nd ed. of Jackson's E&amp;M in the mail, and
got distracted reading the introduction.&nbsp; Turns out that a trivector
"current" term (with basis vectors in the Dirac vector space) to
supplement the four-vector current completely summarizes the mess of B,D,H,E,M,P,J,rho variables  nicely in a fashion very similar to the \grad F = J

May 23, 2009&nbsp; <a href="lorentz_force_tx.pdf">Lorentz boost of Lorentz force equations</a>.&nbsp; My own attempt to walk through the Lorentz transformation of the pair of Lorentz force and power equations, as done in Bohm's 'The Special Theory of Relativity'.&nbsp; Bohm's text left out a number of details (as well as had a number of sign typos and some dropped terms).&nbsp; Try to get it right.&nbsp; Was able to do some of it, but part of the final "the reader can verify bits" have me stumped.&nbsp; How to do those last bits is not obvious to me, which is likely why Bohm left this out of this pseudo-layman book.&nbsp; This set of notes starts off with a large digression (again I think) on how to express and translate from the GA hyperbolic exponential Lorentz boost formulation to the "classical" coordinate and vector representations used in the Bohm text (and other places).&nbsp; My initial reason for writing that up for myself all in one place was that I intended to try the Lorentz force boost procedure of the Bohm text completely in GA form, but I also have not gotten to attempting that (my goal was to finish the details of the "old-fashioned" way first, but the algebra for that way is so messy I don't see how to do it).<br>

Noether's derivation that is specific to the calculation of the
conserved ``current'' for a rotational symmetry is performed.&nbsp; I'd be curious what attack on that question Goldstein was originally thinking of.&nbsp; Although I believe this Noether's current treatment answers the question in full detail, since it wasn't covered yet in the text, is there an easier way to get at the result?<br>

January 18, 2009.&nbsp; <a href="poynting_rate.pdf">Calculate the time rate of change of the Poynting vector, and the associated conservation law</a>.&nbsp; These notes contain the conservation calculation itself, and verify the end result of Schwartz's tricky relativistic argument (that I have yet to understand) to put the conservation into a divergence form that is volume integrable.<br>
<br>
The derivation itself is not too hard.&nbsp; Reconciling all the
different notations is actually the tricky bit.&nbsp; Schwartz does this in terms of the dual
field tensors F and G, Doran/Lasenby have their GA F \gamma_k F formulation,
wikipedia had something different either of than those, and I'd seen in
another paper that Jackson used something completely different (but
don't have Jackson to see how he did it).<br>
<br>
Very interesting here is that we end up with what looks like the Lorentz force law by only looking at conservation requirements based on Maxwell's equation itself.&nbsp; Calling the Poynting vector a field momentum density by analogy (because it showed up in what appeared to be an Energy/momentum (density) four vector) is then seen to be very justifiable.&nbsp; Previously I'd seen that it took two Lagrangians for E&amp;M.&nbsp; One for the fields and one for the interaction term.&nbsp; But now it looks like the interaction term follows from the fields (in a handwaving, fuzzy, not yet fully understood way).&nbsp; Quite interesting, and worth more thought, but seeing how one gets the interaction term from the QM field equation should probably take precedence.<br>

<p>January 11, 2009.&nbsp; <a href="sch_current.pdf">Schrodinger probability density and current conservation equation</a>.&nbsp; Derive the probability current conservation law for myself.</p>
<p>Calculating the rate of change of probability, and using Schrodinger's equation and its conjugate allows for the definition of a probability current, and an electromagnetic like probability-density/current-density conservation law.</p>
<p>What I thought was interesting was that if you put this into a four vector form as a spacetime divergence (ie: the Lorentz gauge of e&amp;m), the resulting "four-component" current vector needs only a \gamma^0 \partial_0 term to be added to it, for that current itself to be the Dirac Lagrangian (omitting the local-gauge term eA).&nbsp; So it looks like taking the spacetime divergence of the Dirac Lagrangian essentially gives you the probability/current conservation equation (except now this would also produce an extra timelike term not there in the original Schrodinger's equation.)&nbsp; There are some notational differences with the wikipedia form of the Dirac Lagrangian, but I believe all the basic content is there once those differences are accounted for.&nbsp; Very suprising to see the Dirac Lagrangian fall so naturally out of the Schrodinger (non-relativistic) equation.<br>
</p>
<p>I also observe that the probability wave function is perhaps naturally expressed as a relativistic four vector (with a \gamma_0 term factored out).&nbsp; I still don't understand how Maxwell's equation and QM fit together, but with Maxwell's equation or Lagrangian expressable strictly in terms of four vectors (or the four-gradient and four-curl of such four vectors), there would be a logical cleanliness if one could also express the (relativistic) QM laws strictly in terms of four vectors.&nbsp; Definitely worth playing with.<br>

<p>January 6, 2009.&nbsp; <a href="dc_power.pdf">DC Power consumption equation derived from Poynting relationship</a>.&nbsp; Work out P = I V from first principles since I forgot it.&nbsp; Well, from second principles I suppose, since I utilize my recent Poynting derivation.<br>

<p>January 5, 2009.&nbsp; <a href="vector_differential_identities.pdf">Some vector differential identities</a>.&nbsp; Translate some identities from the Feynman lectures into GA form.&nbsp; These apply in higher dimensions with the GA formalism, and proofs of the generalized idenities are derived.<br>
</p>
<p>January 5, 2009.&nbsp; <a href="gaussian.pdf">Gaussian bell curve integral evaluation</a>.&nbsp; Nothing fancy, but I couldn't remember how to do it at first.&nbsp; Also added the next two degree Gaussian integrals, and a derivation of the recurrance relations for the higher degree variations.<br>

<p>January 3, 2009.&nbsp; <a href="../math/electric_field_energy.pdf">Electrostatic and magnetostatic field energy</a>.&nbsp;
Start working out for myself the electrostatic and magnetostatic energy
relationships.&nbsp; Got the electrostatic part done, and got as far as a
from first principles Biot-Savart derivation using the STA formalism.&nbsp;
Next work out the magnetostatic energy relationship.&nbsp; Also intend to
tackle wave energy and momentum here, but in the end, may split that
into a separate set of notes.<br>

January 2, 2009.&nbsp; <a href="../math/energy_momentum_tensor.pdf">Some notes on the electromagnetic stress energy-momentum tensor</a>.&nbsp;
As well as some brute force notes on expanding the tensor, the
spacetime divergence of the rest frame elements of this tensor is used
to derive, in a particularily slick fashion IMO, the Poynting energy
momentum current conservation equation (unsure that that is called).&nbsp;
Want to also followup on what's here with a relativistic transformation
approach, but will have to think it through.<br>
