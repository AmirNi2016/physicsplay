some Lagrangian theory, and a touch of quantum mechanics.</p>

Wrote <a href="../sites/sym/gasym.cpp">gasym.cpp</a>, a C++ poor man's mathematica.
This is source code for a simple multivector symbolic calculator.
Also requires
Fontine's 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gasandbox/">ga sandbox</a>
package since I have used
these classes as a backend for the multivector parts.  The symbolic 
calculations were done the quick and dirty lazy way using a stl::map and
stl::list based
expression tree. If you are interested in trying
(or extending this) for your own calculation please let me know that you are doing so (I'd like to keep the core bits single sourced, with enhancements and bugfixes in one place).<br>
</p>
<p>
As coded this "calculator" is applied towards the 
expansion of a quaternion (or scalar plus bivector multivector in the GA lingo) representation of Euler angle exponentials to calculate the rotation matrix in terms of the half angles, and to also compute the rotation matrix in terms of 
Cayley-Klein parameters. <br>

Compare the rotor form to the matrix form.  Tried the derivation in matrix

and discussion ends up being somewhat interesting by itself.
</p>
<p>
Update: Nov 10.  After a digression to write some symbolic GA calculator software, the Cayley-Klein parameterization of the rotation matrix has been revisited.  Found the parameterization associated with problem 2.9 in GAFP.  Identifying the last differences from the book problem was done with a scripted search and replace to generate the 120 different matrixes that are possible with permutation of the parameters, and toggling of their signs (bivector terms also have a degree of freedom in the sign).  This was probably a silly exercise to take to absolute conclusion since the root idea ... that various half angle sine and cosine parameterizations can be used to generate that form of rotation matrix ... is what was important.  Very OCD of me to actually solve this beastie!

Application of Noether's to Lorentz transformed interaction Lagrangian

Boost and or rotation leaves the Lorentz force Lagrangian unchanged implying
a conserved quantity.  The conserved quantity is computed (a set of
wedge product results relating four vectors A, x, v).  This is also
expressed in purely vector form for a specific observer frame, 
producing a pair of vector equations, one of which supplies the
torque on the charged particle supplied by the field.
Finally the result is expressed in tensor and (four-vector) coordinate
form, which like the wedge product representation is also nicely symmetrical.

<li> Flush out a scalar derivation for the math behind Noether's theorem (need to work examples before I really understand what that's for).  Wanted to
derive it myself because of the multivector equivalent from GAFP.

<li>Hamiltonian from change of variables.  Utilized somewhat botched attempt
to derive the scalar (non-multivector) form of Noether's equation.

<li>

dictated by the requirement to match the operational effects of the chain
rule in the linearization of a Lagrangian.

Take more care with the metric signature this time.  Also relates this to
the traditional observer dependent E + v x B form of the equations.  For the
first time the use of the wedge with the time basis vector as a means to 
select rest frame observer dependent quantities makes sense to me.  Perhaps
just because this had nothing to do with the Lorentz velocity addition
where I had trouble seeing how the wedge and the traditional means were
related.

Having formulated this boundary description, this

<p>
Like so many things it seems I can't find treatments that I can understand
easily.
In particular I've found it hard to understand in an intuitive fashion
the generalized
Stokes law or Green's theorem treatment in both GA and differential forms texts.
</p>

<p>
So I've calculated this myself.
</p>

<p>
Covered in this set of notes is:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
The "fundamental theorem" for vector integration (integral of gradient of
a scalar field) is examined first.
</li>
<li>
An examination of bivector differential areas used to calculate and demonstrate
the validity of Jacobian determinants for change of variables.
</li>
<li>
Three special cases of the most general form of Stokes' law are treated.
The first is Green's theorem for integration around a loop in a plane.  Second is Stokes' law integration around the boundary of a general surface, and third
is the volume to surface area result.
</li>
<li>
Divergence relationships are shown to be duality variations of Stokes' law.
</li>
</ol>


<p>
Everything treated here is done in a fashion that 
applies to any metric, as well as any number of dimensions.
</p>

<p>
Left untackled are the four-volume and even higher dimensional varients of Stokes' law.
This is probably enough of the general multivector integral transformation
equations that I can go back and comfortably tackle 
the integral equivalents of the electrodynamics field equations.
</p>
<p>
Also not done are specific examples of volumes and surfaces to get a feel
for this.  Try the hypersphere volume and area calculations from the Flanders
that were obvious to him but not me.  I also suspect that working some examples
of this will allow me to figure out how to represent the boundary surfaces
in the general case (suspect that this can be expressed as an alternating
form, much like the reciprocal basis calculation ... that intuitively makes
sense since we have normal elements constrained to the subspace spanned by the
volume).

<a href="../sites/geometric-algebra/lagrangian_field_density.pdf">Lagrangian field density used to derive Maxwells equation.
</a>
</p>
<p>
I couldn't find a derivation that used the electrodynamic field density to derive Maxwell's equations that I could understand, but puzzled it out myself, using
Feynmans ad-hoc method.
</p>
<p>
Interestingly, which differs from other writeups that I have found, I had to
use both the E dot E - B dot B part (to generate the vector half of the equation),
and used the E dot B part to generate the trivector part of Maxwells equation.
</p>
<p>
The wikipedia article on the electrodynamic tensor has a rather unexplained
description of a Maxwells equation derivation with some sort of field varient
of the Euler Lagrange equations where they apparently do this derivation
using only the scalar part of the squared field.
</p>
<p>
Regardless of whether the E dot B term can be implied in some way, including
it results in a very neat result.  We can form a complex valued
Lagrangian density
from the curl of the vector potential, and use that directly to find the
STA formulation of Maxwells equation without having to reconstruct this
from the tensor results.  This may actually be something that I'm not just
rediscovering!

Derivation of covariant Lorentz force law from proper time Lagrangian equations.
</a>
</p>
<p>
Take a guess at the covariant form of the Lagrangian equations for relativistic correctness.  Use this first derive the proper time force from the kinetic term, and followup with a derivation of the Lorentz force law (in covariant form) after looking at the result of applying this form of Lagrange equations to a velocity plus field dot product.  Although this doesn't start at the most fundamental point (ie: it assumes the form of the Lagrange equations instead of demonstrating that they actually solve the minimization problem), it is still
a very cool result, and what I expect may be a high point in my current understanding of pre-quantum level physics for quite a while.

Expanded notes on covarient Lorentz force law.
</a>
</p>
<p>
I now understand enough of the GAFP derivation (section 5.5.3, The Lorentz force law) that I can follow it.  However, I found that it still needed a lot of
margin notes to make it clear for myself.  Here
I try the derivation on my own.  Without the GAFP text, this is likely not
a good standalone explaination.
</p>
<p>
Once I got as far as understanding this covariant form, apply it to
expressing the Lorentz force in potential form.  Having seen the Lagrangian
for electrodynamics using the electrostatic potential field, and the vector
magnetic potential field, the obvious question is how one would express that
Lagrangian in a more symmetric four vector form.  I get as far as expressing
the proper Lorentz force as a spacetime gradient.  However, having done so I'm

Explicit expansion of Lorentz boost applied to rest frame event vector.

<p>
Dumbly plug through the algebra to see why GAFP can casually write their
four velocities as: v R = R gamma_0.

Use this result to show how the projective split that utilizes the wedge product and dot product ratios of proper velocities works.  That's yet another result from GAFP that I didn't understand reading their text.

Also transform both proper velocities to switch which worldline is observed
in its rest frame.  This demonstrates that the relative velocity is independant
of such a common transformation which matches intuition.  That said, 
intuition with
relativitistic issues is a hard to come by and I don't yet trust what I do have
of it.

What I did not demonstrate yet is whether this projective split is independent
of any boost.  I'll probably return to that later (and assume for now.)

Cauchy Riemann equations expressed as a gradient.
</a>
</p>
<p>
With some manipulation, it is shown that the pair of Cauchy-Riemann equations that describe the conditions that the function is analytic (has a derivative), may also be expressed as a single gradient equation.  Specifically, that the gradient of a complex function is zero in all analytic regions.  The gradient here is used in multivector form, where the complex imaginary is expressed as a plane 
unit spatial pseudoscalar (unit bivector).

We are used to seeing that real and imaginary
components of complex functions are harmonic (sum of second partials equal zero).  We see that this follows directly from the fact that the gradient (a vector square root of the scalar Laplace operator) is zero.
I thought this was a kind of neat result, and suspect that it can be related to
residue calculus in a plane.

</p>

<p>There are some subtleties to understand what it means for the speed of light to be constant.  I cannot say definitively that I still have an satisfactory or intuitive feel for such this constancy.  I think it is easier to to conceptualize the idea that light (ie: an electrodynamic field) is wavelike regardless of the motion of the observer.  Specifically, that light must satisfy the wave equation (ie: Maxwell’s equations) regardless of the space and time parameterization.</p>



<p>This little doc (which I am pleased with) presents a derivation of the Lorentz transformation using the wave equation.  This approach does requires a bit more math than the typical expanding light shell method, but is possibly more intuitive.  I’m curious if somebody else also new to the subject of relativity would agree?</p>

<p>The reciprocal frame vector concept is extremely powerful, and the way too dense and short treatment of this in the GAFP book isn’t sufficient to learn from in my opinion.  Here are my notes on this which are more thorough and dumb than the GAFP book.  Despite the treatment in that book being so short it has a rather fundamental place in much of the notation used later in the book (like all the index upper and lower notation).  Perhaps this isn’t well covered in their book because they assume familiarity by virtue of having seen this in the context of tensor algebra.  There appear to be enough people thoroughly confused by the tensor notation and covariant and contravarient nomenclature that I think this formulation in terms of simple vector operations well justified.  It also makes it easier to understand the more complex tensors.  An example is the electromagnetic field tensor which we later see to be a coordinate description of a bivector.</p>

In particular vector vector products are well covered in the texts (GAFP, NFCM), but other higher order products are covered in much less detail.  Some of the questions that I had when writing up these notes led to the purchase of the book “Geometric Algebra for Computer Science” (GASC).  That book, which has by far the best introduction to the subject to be had, ended up covering much of the material I felt missing in the other texts.  Much of that missing detail I had worked myself by the time I had received that book, but it was still a very worthwhile read.  Later I found the 
<a href="http://staff.science.uva.nl/%7Efontijne/phd/fontijne_phd.pdf">

</a>
by one of the authors which contains much of that text, and is just as readable as the book.   If you want a good intro to the subject before purchasing any texts, give that thesis a read.  I find a book much easier to read than a computer screen, but this particular book uses a different notation than all the others, which is distracting, so you can get an idea of some of the content before a purchase by looking at the thesis.
