Using the Boost.Test framework (see lecture 6 of the software development part), write a test for each of these functions to ensure that they get the right value of the roots if you start at the root (by the way, what are the root precisely?).

debug: -1 should be a root too.  plot the function.  Got errors with:

   ./findroot -x -10 -X 0 --brent

for completeness ought to implement an interval search method to look for an initial interval that has opposite signs within the initial interval if the interval expansion method doesn't find bound a root.

switch to iostream for mysolver.cc bits that remain from the gsl docs example for consistency.

need rc checking in more places (gsl doc sample relied on abort handler).  Read the docs to see how each function can fail.  use gsl_strerror and gsl_errno as appropriate.

DONE:

- Finish doxygen markup for the rest of the code is commented.
