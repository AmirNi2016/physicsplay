In this assignment, you are to use numerical root finding to solve the equation

   [\exp(1-x^2)-1]\exp[{sin(x)}] = 0

To this end:

   - Install the GSL on your machine.

   - Using the GSL's root finding capabilities, write two functions to solve the equation, one using Newton-Raphson and the other using the false-position method. The solution should be accurate up to 1 part in 10,000.

   - Using the Boost.Test framework (see lecture 6 of the software development part), write a test for each of these functions to ensure that they get the right value of the roots if you start at the root (by the way, what are the root precisely?).

   - Also write a main function to compute, using both methods, the roots of the equation above, for varying initial values x0 for x, or for varying starting intervals [0.0,x0], where x0 ranges from 0 to 10 in steps of 0.5.

   - Use make through out, such that the default 'make' command (without arguments) compiles the main function, and 'make test' compiles and runs the tests.

Submit git log, makefile, code, and a text file with a discussion of the convergence and stability comparison by Thursday February 12, 9:00 AM
