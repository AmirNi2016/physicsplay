Homework 8: PDEs

 
In homework 2 you modularized the code "wave1d.cc", which solves the damped 1D wave equation:
\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial t^2} - c^2 \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2} + (\frac{1}{\tau}) \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = 0  


with boundary conditions \small u(x_1,t)=u(x_2,t)=0,

and initial conditions of a triangle form:

 \small u(x,0) = 0                                                 for    \small x<x_1+L/4  
 \small u(x,0) = (x-x_1-L/4)/L                  for    \small x_1+L/4 < x < (x_1+x_2)/2  
 \small u(x,0) = 0.5-(x-x_1-L/4)/L      for    \small (x_1 + x_2)/2 < x < x_2 - L/4 
 \small u(x,0) = 0                                                 for    \small x>x_2-L/4 

 where \small L=x_2-x_1. 

The code reads the parameters used from a file passed as a command argument, i.e. if the executable is named: 'wave1dsolver', by executing "./wave1dsolver waveparams.txt", it will use the parameters defined in 'waveparams.txt'.  Notice that if not file is indicated in the command line, the solver will assume some default values hard-coded within the code. 

ASSIGNMENT: modularize the code (if you haven't already done so) and re-implement the timestepping portion of the code two different ways, as discussed below, using matrix operators as shown in class.  The timestepping portion of the equation is

\small u_{i+1} = \left[2 - \frac{\Delta t}{\tau} + \Delta t^2 F\right] u_i - \left[1 - \frac{\Delta t}{\tau}\right]u_{i-1}

where \small F is the Laplacian operator and i is the time index.

Create a matrix operator to calculate the first term on the right hand side.
Use cblas routines to calculate the matrix-vector and scalar-vector operations needed to increment the timestep.
Save the output in a netCDF file. 
Implement your matrix-vector operation two ways: 1) using a full matrix including all zeros and 2) using a matrix stored in banded format, with appropriate multiplication routines, such as dgbmv.  Implement the operations in separate files, with separate entries in your Makefile.
Use the "time" command to determine which method is faster.  Discuss.
Please submit:

all source, header, make  and discussion files for the new program.
the output of 'git log' for your code development. We expect to see several commits, and meaningful comments.
