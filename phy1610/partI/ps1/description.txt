Homework 1: C++ exercise

For this homework, you are to write a C++ program that generates a table of data. The table should have two columns, one column with x values ranging from -2.0 to 2.0, and a second column with values y=tanh(2x). In particular, your program should:
Provide and use a function f that takes x as input and returns the value of tanh(2x).
Divides the interval [-2,2] into n=100 segments.
Compute the value (x) of the midpoint of each segment and the value (y) of the function f at those midpoints.
Write out the x and y values in tabular form (i.e. two-column ascii text), either to a file or to screen.
Be sure to comment your code!
Compile and run your code using g++, and capture the output. Submit code, output file, and a text file describing the compilation command and the run command, by January 15, 2015, at 9:00 am. Use the "Assignment Dropbox" on the course website for the submission.
