Homework 3: Matrix Objects

source code: https://support.scinet.utoronto.ca/education/get.php/makethiswork.cc

The attached code (corrected version as of January 25, 2015, 4:10 pm) uses a class MyMatrix defined through "mymatrix.h". The class also has several member functions or methods defined acting on it, such as: get_rows, get_columns, set_element, output which are basically defined as their names indicate. For instance,

get_rows(), returns the number of rows of its object
get_columns(), returns the number of columns of its object
set_element(i,j, value), sets the content of the element "i,j" of the object to "value"
output(filename), prints out the object to the file named "filename" in text as rows and columns.
constructor: creates, allocates and initializes the object matrix.
destructor: eleminates the object and releases the memory allocated for the object.


ASSIGNMENT: For this homework, you will have to implement the class "MyMatrix", along with the 6 methods previously described. The implementation has to be done in two additional separate files: a header file ("MyMatrix.h") and an implementation file ("MyMatrix.cpp"). 
As usual you have to use version control with git, create a makefile to compile and link this project; and then run this code using 
"./makethiswork 100 200 output.dat" 
to generate a file with a 100x200 floating point matrix that will be filled with Gaussian distributed values. 
Please submit:
all source, header and make files for the new program.
the "output.dat" file generated by your code.
the output of 'git log' for your code development. We expect to see several commits, and meaningful comments
