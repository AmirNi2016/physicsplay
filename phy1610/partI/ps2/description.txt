Homework 2: Modularity, Make and Git

source code: https://support.scinet.utoronto.ca/education/get.php/wave1d.cc
parameter file: https://support.scinet.utoronto.ca/education/get.php/waveparams.txt

This program: "wave1d.cc", solves the 1-dim wave equation, \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial t^2} - c^2 \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2} + (\frac{1}{\tau}) \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = 0  

with boundary conditions u(x_1,t)=u(x_2,t)=0,

and initial conditions of a triangle form:
 u(x,0) = 0 for x<x_1+L/4  
 u(x,0) = (x-x_1-L/4)/L for x_1+L/4<(x_1+x_2)/2  
 u(x,0) = 0.5-(x-x_1-L/4)/L for x_1+L/4<(x_1+x_2)/2 
 u(x,0) = 0 for x>x_2-L/4 


where L=x_2-x_1. 

The code reads the parameters used from a file passed as a command argument, i.e. if the executable is named: 'wave1dsolver', by executing "./wave1dsolver waveparams.txt", it will use the parameters defined in 'waveparams.txt', and will output the results to the standard output. Notice that if not file is indicated in the command line, the solver will assume some default values hard-coded within the code. 
You are welcome to inspect this file and play around with the parameter values. 

ASSIGNMENT: put this code under version control with git and modify it into a new, **modularized** version:

Create as many functions (headers and implementation files, do not forget preprocessor guards) as you find reasonable/necessary (e.g., input,output,parameters,single-step solver, driver, etc.).
Create a Makefile to compile this project.
Use your favourite plotting tool to take a look of the results and check if they make sense?

The original file should become just a 'driver', containing main, that solves the same problem as the original code. 


Please submit:

all source, header and make files for the new program.
the output of 'git log' for your code development. We expect to see several commits, and meaningful comments.
