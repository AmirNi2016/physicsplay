Starting from the same code as for assignment 9, you are going to replace the text output with binary output using netcdf. 
Do the following on the GPC:

$ git clone /scinet/course/scientific_computing/2016/hw11
$ cd hw11
$ source setup
In this directory you will find the serial implementation of the 1d wave equation. It takes its parameters from a file called "waveparams.txt". The whole thing gets compiled with "make".

Your assignment is to replace the text output with netcdf.

Add a parameter to the parameter file to be read, that contains a filename.

   DONE.

The output should contain:
   - the array of valid x values
      DONE.
   - and the rho array at each of those time values.
      DONE.

The rho array depends on time and space, thus, in the file, it becomes a 2d array, although it isn't one in the code.
   DONE.

You can get bonus points if you 
   encorporate this in you mpi version of the code, using the netcdf parallel routines. 
      DONE.

Write the attributes out to the netcdf file as an additional metadata block.
   DONE.

The output should contain:
   - the array of the time values at which output takes place
      DONE.

Write a nc reader for the wave1d output
   readwavenc.cc introduced as a starting point for this.

============================
TODO:

Make the nc reader output consistent with the ascii output.

Write a test driver for that comparison to functional test the netcdf writing code.

Using waveparams.txt, compare the time it takes to run with ascii vs. netcdf, and compare the size of the text file vs. the netcdf file as well.

put in a try/catch block in wave1d main.

introduce a close function to remove throws from the destructor if they occur.

Submit code, data files, git log, and a description of your findings by Apr 14, 2016.
