Model
-----
A weight is suspended from a non-ideal spring. In the model to be used in this assignment, if m is the mass of the weight in kilograms, and x is the spring extension in meters, the potential energy of the spring and the weight are, respectively, given by

E_s(x) = a\left[  \frac{b}{x} + \frac{d^2}{f(x-d)^2} - \exp\left\{\frac{-c(x-b)^2}{2a}\right\}\right]

E_w(x) = -mgx

so that the total energy is given by

E_t(x) = E_s(x) + E_w(x).

In these expression, the parameters are as follows: 
a = 1 J (energy scale) 
b = 0.1 m (length scale) 
c = 100 N/m (spring constant) 
d = 0.5 m(maximum spring extension) 
f = 2500 (stiffness at maximum extension) 
g = 9.8 m/s^2 (gravitational accelleration).

The weight will be in equilibrium when x is at a minimum of the energy function E_t(x). It turns out there are two local minima: one regular one, and one at a larger extension, which we interpret as the spring having been stretched beyond its limits.

Assignment
----------
For this assignment:

- Write a single function f_all_min that, given the mass m of the weight, determines the x positions and energy values of both mimima of E_t. In this function, you are to use the GSL library's implementation of the Brent method for finding minima.
- Use the function f_all_min to find the mass-extension relation. Do this by determining the x value of Et$'s global minimum (i.e., the lowest of its minima) for a range of 25 mass values between 0 and 0.5 kg. Your program should write this data to a file in column format.
- The maximum load m, i.e. the value of the mass m at which the two local minima have the same energy. One way to implement this is to use one of the GSL root finding algorithms on a function that gives the difference of the energy values of the two minima, which can be obtained from f_all_min. The value of the maximum load can be printed out to the console.

As in previous assignments, you should still use git version control and a makefile for your code. For simplicity, use one single git repository for the assignment.

Please submit:
-------------

- All source, header and make files.
- The output of your code.
- The output of 'git log' from the development of your codes.
Submit by February 25, 2016. The late policy can be found in the syllabus.
