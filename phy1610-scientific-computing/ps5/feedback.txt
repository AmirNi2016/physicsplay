Excellent documentation!
Excellent modularity even for the makefile!
Something is wrong with your minimum finder, for lower masses (0-0.17kg) the global minimum should be around 0.15-0.16, however your code is reporting x~0.4... I'm wondering whether it could be a typo in the equation, as the maximum load computation is also off, it should be m~0.1653kg
