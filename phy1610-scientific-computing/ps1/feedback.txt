A bit more of a full-fledge application then we were looking for, but
good. The program does write out to screen, though. By redirecting,
as you did, you can make the output go to a file, however this was not
the assignment. Finally note: it is generally preferred to use
"const" instead of "#define" for constants (with the exception of
include guards).

Mark: 9.5 out of 10
