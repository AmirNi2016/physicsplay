   'Exploring physics with Geometric Algebra' -- a too large collection of Geometric Algebra related math and physics.

notes/miscphysics/

   A collection of mostly non-Geometric Algebra related math physics notes (since my GA stuff is collected separately).

notes/phy354/

   Personal study notes on Lagrangians, and Hamiltonians (Reading of Goldstein, ... ).
   These are currently part of the posted gabook.pdf, but I've pulled them into this collection because
   gabook is too big.

   There are also some classical mechanics notes and problems from auditing a small subset of
   'Advanced Classical Mechanics', taught by Prof. Erich Poppitz.
   I only ended up doing the first problem set from that course, although I still indend to go back and
   revisit the rest to ensure I've got these basics down.

   This collection of notes is not currently posted in pdf form in its entirety.

   test program that reads AT_PLATFORM from the ELF binary object header.

env/

   some aliases, and .vimrc, sort of stuff.

studentNumberGrep/

   a little perl regex sample for somebody

tmcache/
